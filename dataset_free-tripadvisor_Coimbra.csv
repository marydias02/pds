The museum is built on the site of a Roman forum. You start your tour by exploring the ancient infrastructure. The extent of what has been maintained is staggering. The highlight of the museum for me was the extensive collection of sculptures from the Roman to the Renaissance periods. To see the progression from Roman elegance to the primitive Medieval to the magnificence of the Renaissance was fascinating.
This museum should not be missed.

This museum is much larger than expected and some exhibits are better curated than others. The museum poorly lays out the path they expect you to take between the exhibits and they rudely direct you where they expect you to start which is going. It starts by going down 2 floors to the roman ruins under the museum which they do not warn is well ill-suited for people with mobility concerns and no elevator access. After going back up the 2 stories to the main entry, they put you on the elevator up two stories to the main exhibit which is laid out how they want you to traverse it and separated into art based on material - stone, statues, paintings, metal, pottery, textiles, and misc. furniture and dumps you out into the gift shop... with a carriage off to the side. Primarily the art is of Christian focus but most everything has descriptions in Portuguese and English.

Most important lesson - If you see a bathroom, use it then for the museum workers will not permit you to go backwards through the exhibit to reconnect with your party who are still browsing! To make it more difficult - There aren't many places to rest through this very long winding museum and the floor is in poor shape. ","Long museum that disconnects you from your group.","2022-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","2022-03-12T13:02:55-0500","Jamie","G","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.81BEF6DF3152D5432FA410F563B94820","en_US","0","Jamie G","0",,"user","81BEF6DF3152D5432FA410F563B94820",,,"Jamie G","en","false","2022-11-01T09:23:12-04:00","5","We spent about 3 hours here (which includes taking lots of pictures) and could have easily spent more time browsing everything.

It is a very odd mixture of art, architecture and history.  The bottom two floors are an excavated, Roman forum from 2000 years ago.  The museum is built on top on the Roman forum because it is housed in a palace that was built on the Roman ruins.  I have no idea how they were able to excavate the Roman ruins with a building on top of it, but it is amazing.  The forum has two levels of similar sized rooms, at least 20 or 30 rooms plus long halls.  It is like a maze.  The main museum is three floors above the Roman ruins.  It has an excellent collection of sculptures over many centuries, with excellent collections from the 15th and 16th centuries.  There is a sublime collection of medieval and more recent metal work.  There are some very fine religious paintings and some decorative arts including tapestries.  Much of the art was not familiar to me.  We were entranced.  There is also a nice cafe with seating on the outdoor terrace.  It mainly has drinks and snacks.  It has great views over the city.  We spent two hours here and felt like we could have spent more.  It's that good.","fantastic, must see museum","2020-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/ef/fe/dutch-brother.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/ef/fe/dutch-brother.jpg","101","0","199","147","9","249","0","497","2004-01-06T00:00:00-0500","Warren","V","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.16D1412898FEFA137D8758711F91796F",,"0","Warren V","0",,"user","16D1412898FEFA137D8758711F91796F","60745","Boston, Massachusetts","Warren V","en","false","2020-02-01T00:58:35-05:00","4","It was a rainy day so we popped in here and were pleasantly entertained.

We loved the Roman ruins & have seen many Roman ruins in Italy, Israel, Croatia, & Turkey. We were the only ones in the ruins at the time & it was creepy but enjoyable.

We loved the rest of the museum also. The artwork was really impressive.

Museum security allowed me to use the elevator since I use a cane- I really appreciated that.

We were there for 1.5 hours & could have used more time.

In Romanesque style, this cathedral probably replaced an earlier cathedral of which nothing is known, and was used for the coronation of the king of Portugal. From the time of the Reconquista to now little has been changed with modest additions in the Renaissance style that have not altered the original style. Like the cathedral of Lisbon, this too has a fortress-like appearance perhaps determined by the situation of long-standing belligerence existing in those times. Even the hundreds of sculptured capitals, all without human figures, are a clear consequence of that period in which Christianity and Islam fought but also influenced each other.","A well-preserved cathedral of the time of the Reconquista","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","196","0","0","16","96","10","0","222","2016-12-04T11:31:32-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","187824","La Spezia, Italy","bluebay06","en","false","2022-12-02T09:55:45-05:00","5","We wished we had had more time to explore this beautiful cathedral.

There, too, you won`t understand: the church in front of you or still a fortress. By the way, maybe that's why the cathedral was quickly built on the site of the church destroyed by the Moors: starting in 1164 and ending in 20 years. a very short time for cathedrals. It should be understood that Portugal didn`t have personnel at that time and the cathedral was built by French architects Robert and Bernard. Moreover, Robert also worked on the Lisbon Cathedral. It's like a conveyor belt. But the Cathedral of Coimbra remained the only Portuguese Romanesque cathedral, unlike Lisbon and others, thoroughly rebuilt. The main feature of the Romanesque style of the cathedral is the large number (300) of capitals (tops of columns). If Romanesque artists under the influence of Byzantium did not use plant and geometric images in the capitals, but tried to depict animals and people, then here on the contrary. This is due to the fact that mozarabe (converted Christians) were building the Cathedral. They are not used to portraying people, because it is forbidden in Islam. The cathedral has not escaped subsequent influences, but they are present in fragments. Gothic is present in several tombs and most importantly in the cloister. The cloister is very large and part of the hillside was demolished to build it. Renaissance elements are also present in the cathedral. The Gate of Hope-Porta Especiosa was built in the 1530s by the French sculptor Joao de Rouen. He also created a magnificent retable with the image of Jesus and the apostles in the southern apse 30 years later. And, of course, the decoration of the cathedral is the main Renaissance altar created from 1498 to 1502 by Flemish artists Olivier de Gand and Jean d'Ypres.","The only Portuguese unrebuilt Romanesque cathedral,","2020-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/10/07/5f/8d/vadimm67.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/07/5f/8d/vadimm67.jpg","2885","0","15","274","7745","571","0","3731","2013-01-01T13:35:13-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.836BAA8786B81033412B950CF5BDA70C","ru_RU","0",,"0",,"user","836BAA8786B81033412B950CF5BDA70C","298501","Murmansk, Russia","VadimM67","en","false","2020-08-23T13:15:12-04:00","5","A very nice romanesque cathedral.

Note: We did not plan ahead which is not our style but luckily it worked out for us (probably because it was January and not high tourist season). Arrived and found a parking space and made our way to the University. Asked some students and we were pointed in the direction of the ticket office. As luck would have it, we were able to get 3 tickets for a 12:45 entry to the library. This was key because all the buildings close from 1-2 for lunch. We made our way over to the library entrance and promptly admitted at 12:45. Able to have our 15-20 minutes admiring and then sown out. 
The university did close but we were able to find a nearby popular lunch spot that had one table for 3. Once we finished lunch - headed back to see some of the other buildings at 2. The entire entrance courtyard area was filled with people for the 2pm entry. They allow about 60 people every 20 minutes so keep this in mind in the summer. 
We explored some of the other buildings and continued our road trip.
If you can pre plan and buy your tickets ahead of time, this would be encouraged during the high tourist season. There were a few students with the black cloaks and they were very kind - and proud - to allow people to take photos of them. This is a beautiful university - highly recommend you read about the library and student life before you visit. learn about the uniform ( ribbon colors) and the bats that help keep the books preserved in the library.","Lovely few hours exploring this campus","2023-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/50/e4/e6/tber.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/50/e4/e6/tber.jpg","133","0","97","29","531","198","0","360","2004-09-28T00:00:00-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E8F031831F31F122C64939FDA5A49E0C",,"0",,"0",,"user","E8F031831F31F122C64939FDA5A49E0C","46669","New Providence, New Jersey","tber","en","false","2023-02-17T02:38:16-05:00","5","The university of coimbra is a precious jewel of portuguese heritage.

Arriving at the university we had to ask to reach the ticket office which we discovered to be far from the university and close to the old Chemical Laboratory at the end of Rua Estudos. Since the most famous part to visit is the Joanina Library, when you buy the ticket you also get the time at which you can access the library where the visit is guided. The visit to the university must then be defined on the basis of the time of access to the library. We first visited the Royal Palace where the Great Acts Room (former Throne Room) and the Private Exam Room are very interesting. Then through the University of Law corridors we arrived at the Capela de S. Miguel. The visit to the library starts from a side door of the Palace of Schools which is reached by going down a staircase. This guided tour begins in the not very interesting Academic Prison, then continues in the Intermediate Floor (a space which is used as a repository for less important books and documents that do not have space in the Library) and finally goes up to the Noble Floor of the Library.

Visiting it's grounds is the best thing you can do in this town. There're several types of tickets, depending how much you want to see.
We found the basic ticket (around 12 Euros) to be more than sufficient as it includes the Chemical laboratory, University Palace (which served as seat of power in 12-13 c when Coimbra was a capital), as well the astonishing Sao Miguel Chapel and Joanina Library.
BEWARE you cannot buy tickets on the spot at the University square. Tickets for the entire University complex are sold across the Chemical Laboratory which is around the corner of the new Se Cathedral (some 10 min walk from the University square itself). Very illogical, but that's it - do that first to avoid double walking like we did.

What you can see is an exhibition and a 15-minute film, the monastery itself is just to be seen from the outside, from the street.
The Santa Clara Monastery was built in 1314 by D. Isabel de Aragon, the Holy Queen, replacing a small convent of Clarissa nuns founded in 1286. The temple was completed in 1330. At the end of the 20th century, extensive restoration work was carried out, which uncovered the structures and a vast and diversified estate. Once again open to visits, the Monastery offers a leisure area in a wide open-air route that includes the church and the restored archaeological structures. In the Interpretative Centre, in addition to the exhibition of the objects found here, structured according to the monastic experience, audiovisual means are used to present the history of the place and its requalification.","Visiting Coimbra.","2021-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","1686","0","133","166","8759","222","0","2075","2011-09-25T09:37:40-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","1444586","Santa Comba Dao, Portugal","hans-jaguar","en","false","2021-07-30T13:10:25-04:00","5","Very helpful staff and beautiful building.

It is for me a favourite due to the oddity in its configuration. Although it's called a monastery, it was in fact a convent and presents the main lateral entrance as it should. The rest of the building is different and surprising. The fact that some floors are missing left the rib vaults completey exposed adding to the experience of visiting a building that dates from the XIV century and was almost completely destroyed up to a few decades ago.","One of my favourite","2019-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg","7","0","0","1","0","10","0","18","2015-04-14T17:27:44-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F588C01F79153FDD5F4443C8015CBDEE","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","F588C01F79153FDD5F4443C8015CBDEE","189180","Porto, Portugal","molavof","en","false","2019-05-26T13:12:10-04:00","5","We stumbled on the ruined Convent of Santa Clara-a-Velha late on our first afternoon in Coimbra, after walking along the Mondego river and visiting the gardens of the Quinta das Lágrimas. This 13th-century convent was strongly associated with Portugal's saintly queen, Santa Isabel, and was an important pilgrimage site during the medieval period and beyond, until it had to be abandoned in 1677 due to the river's constantly rising floodwaters. After painstaking archeological and restoration work, the ruins can now be visited. You first make your way through the small museum/information centre, with many interesting artifacts and a great deal of information (unfortunately, the explanatory notes are only in Portuguese at the moment, but if you persevere you can understand enough to get the gist). There is an absorbing documentary video shown in the auditorium and if you can catch one with English subtitles (ours was at 5.30pm) it is well worth watching, as it sets everything in a richer historical context. Then you make your way out into the ruins of the convent church and cloisters, where the explanatory notices, though few in number, are in both Portuguese and English. It is a quiet, contemplative and evocative sacred space.","Atmospheric ruins","2019-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0a/b2/44/29/john8tea.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/b2/44/29/john8tea.jpg","21","0","2","12","29","7","0","40","2014-06-11T21:46:34-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.91D1BB577BA888CC7F46031F5236821D","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","91D1BB577BA888CC7F46031F5236821D","298207","Fukuoka, Japan","john8tea","en","false","2019-05-24T05:13:16-04:00","5","It is marvellously evocative and atmospheric.

Not a lot was blooming in February but there was still plenty to see.  There were some huge and obviously extremely old camellia trees and a very attractive formal garden at the top.  We then walked down via a bamboo grove almost as big as those I've had the pleasure to see in Japan.  There were some parts of the garden which were overgrown and others where the ground had been churned up presumably by tractors and it certainly seemed a bit neglected in places. Nevertheless a very pleasant way to walk from the upper town down to the river.

Tips about Coimbra, starting from ‘’Down to Top’’ or as our hotel concierge said ‘’da Baixa para a Alta’’:

- Visit the ‘’Largo da Portagem’’ or Portagem Square: use that opportunity to take some pictures from Santa Clara Bridge and to eat some typical regional sweets on ‘’Briosa’’.
- Go all the way up, from the downtown part to the university: go from street Ferreira Borges, passing by on ‘’Arco da Almedina’’, continue to go up to find ‘’Fado ao Centro’’ if you want to listen to Coimbra Fado (it is different from Lisboa Fado) or get a glass of wine on ‘’Quebra o’galho’’ (tapas/bar). After running up the ‘’Quebra Costas’’ which means in english ‘’back breaker’’ (it is just a super old staircase),  you will find ‘’Sé Velha’’ (the old church) and in within 5 more minutes you will arrive to Coimbra University, on that area you can look for the Law School (the one with the beautiful tower, that you can visit) and look for ‘’Biblioteca Joanina’’ (the one with Bat’s).
- Botanic Garden – just do not miss it, it is not that big and it is super close from the University. 😊
- On your way down to the car just go to ‘’Praça da Republica’’/’’Republic Square, where you can find ‘’Cartola’’ the most iconic college bar in Coimbra, where you can ask for a ‘’fino’’/ craft beer.
- Follow the road then turn left: As we said, just go down on that road feel watching the gardens, pass over the ‘’Mercado’’ and turn left on the City Hall, and you will find Square 8th of may and Sta. Cruz Curch, after that you only need to to go all the way on street Ferreira Borges again until you find your car.
- Just a few restaurants in case you start to get hungry: Dux, Zé Manel dos Ossos, Restaurante O Nacional, Praxys and Restaurante Joaquim dos Leitões (the speciality is Suckling Pig, literally one of the best if not the best thing you can try in Portugal).","Beautiful curated botanical garden - worth a walkthrough before or after visiting the University","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/19/71/1c/bc/8-drank-was-merry.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/71/1c/bc/8-drank-was-merry.jpg","229","0","0","31","1878","288","0","548","2012-09-21T17:49:09-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.5697E53BDDD8CBBE2F341EBC72911D6C","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","5697E53BDDD8CBBE2F341EBC72911D6C","34467","Naples, Florida","8-drank-was-merry","en","false","2019-10-10T11:06:31-04:00","4","Despite reconstruction work taking place late September 2019, it's still worth visiting.

Duly turned up at 16.20 and were shown the Baroque library which of course is stunning and worth a visit.  Left in there for 10mins with just a sheet for info so we looked up some more info on our mobiles.  It would be better to have a guide to talk about the library and point out all the interesting features.  We felt we were just shut in there for 10mins and when our time was up, a door was opened and we were unceremoniously shown out back into the square.  From there, we had no idea how to get to any of the other places listed on our ticket so we headed to the gift shop to ask.  We were given directions to the Chapel (again, stunning and worth a visit),  and after a quick look around, we asked the staff member how to get to the Royal Palace only to be told it closed at 16.45!  We didn't bother going to the chemistry lab as we had no idea how to get there and assumed it would be closed too.  As it was raining heavily, we didn't visit the botanical gardens.  We headed back to shop to have a look round about 16.50pm to be told by the staff member that it was shut.  All in all, I feel the signage is poor and was shocked that they offer tickets at 16.40 on the website when thst only gives you time to visit the library and nothing else! Perhaps there is the option to go to the other items on the ticket before the library - but this is not made clear - there is NO info whatsoever about this.  We felt disappointed and ripped off - this could be done better....","Buyer beware...","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","4","0","2","1","0","2","0","7","2012-10-03T13:39:41-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.C3289C544D2327D1A7E68A8EA61BC3CA","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","C3289C544D2327D1A7E68A8EA61BC3CA","186361","Oxford, United Kingdom","mimi1767","en","false","2023-03-06T21:13:47-05:00","5","Magical place to visit in Coimbra university.

It follows that the visit to the different parts of the University must be organized and divided keeping in mind this time. For example we had the time to visit the Royal Palace with the Great Acts Room (former Throne Room) and the Private Exam Room leaving the rest until after the library visit. The entrance to the library (a side door of the Palace of Schools) is accessed by going down a staircase located at the right end of the square looking at the Mondego river. The guided (but not informative) tour begins with ticket checking and then you are directed without explanation to an area immediately to the left of the access door. A series of unfurnished and insignificant rooms which we later discovered were the Academic Prisons (we don't know for whom). After about ten minutes uselessly spent here, the guided tour continues in the Intermediate Floor (a space which is used as a repository for less important books and documents that do not have space in the Library). Here we took the only photos because we were told that photography was prohibited on the next floor. After another ten minutes we were able to go up to the Noble Floor of the Library.  Here without any explanation we remained about ten minutes in the central corridor from which we could see the shelves with precious books, the reading tables and the refined furnishings of the walls and ceiling. Certainly, given the distant date of foundation of the University of Coimbra, the books contained here will be of inestimable value and it is right that they are preserved by controlling the environment and optimizing the visits, but perhaps the procedures of this tour should be completely reconsidered.","A tour whose procedures should be reconsidered","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","196","0","0","16","96","10","0","222","2016-12-04T11:31:32-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","187824","La Spezia, Italy","bluebay06","en","false","2022-12-09T23:42:33-05:00","2","It may be controversial to say… but this is nothing special.

The guy at the entrance door tells us in an annoyed tone that we have to climb the stairs to buy the tickets since the online system does not work (wrong: it works, we bought our tickets online) and that there are no toilets on the premises (wrong: there are toilets, read further on). Then, when a group of 20-30 people are gathered outside the entrance door, he graciously herds us all into the first room, the academic prison, and graciously locks us in. BTW: we were stuck there for ten minutes with 20-30 people and my husband I were the ONLY people wearing a mask (ours were FFP2 masks). After ten minutes of waiting (no explanation provided, only sticky papers if you dare to touch them, or qrcode that do not work since there is no connection in there), a white door opens and a young woman ushers us to the second room (a sort of 'new library') welcoming us with a series of 'don't'. We are locked again between two doors. No way back, no way forward. And, again, no explanation provided. Other ten minutes of waiting and then the young woman opens another door and, after climbing a very steep staircase, we are finally admitted to the sancta sanctorum of the Joanina Library. Beautiful and interesting: ancient books, painted woods, and trompe l'oeil. Beautiful and interesting library but not so rare I would say, if you know other ancient libraries - there are so many around Europe, and in most of them you can even sit and study!! Can you imagine that?? Again, other ten minutes stuffed in a locked room with people with no masks. We try to move to reach the exit but the man there says he cannot open the door because the light would ruin the books. EXcuse me??? Other equally ancient libraries around Europe have adopted more sophisticated systems to prevent the book decay than locking up 20-30 people in the same room. When we are finally out, we move towards the attached chapel where we are welcomed by a smiling lady (finally!), we are able to visit it and to get out at our convenience - at the exit door, another smiling man. The toilets are on the left when you leave the chapel - can anyone inform the guy at the entrance, please?
A final note. After a few days, my husband and I are not feeling well. To cut it short, we got both positive. Is this a legacy of being stuck for so long in crowded rooms in the Joanina Library? It's a good thing taking care of books, but I would also say that taking care of people is an equally good thing. And, if you can't imagine a more rational system of a visiting path, at least ask everyone to wear a mask. Icing on the cake: the ticket costs 12.50 per person - 25 euros for two is a huge price for such an awful experience.","Worst visting experience EVER!!

At least you know how was the foundation of Portugal? Do you think it was with hugs and kisses? No my friend, it was a bloody mess. They had to kill a lot of “mouros” (North African people)… - you know who you are (the laugh buy from France). 

And if you expect to know more about Portugal, just google it please.. everyone complaining about the lack of digital stuff, but don’t google info…

It was built around 1940 when the dictator Salazar organized the famous ""Portuguese World"" exhibition in Lisbon to rebuilt the idea of Portuguese colonialism. At that time, the regime propaganda spread the ideology that there was only a Portugal from ""Minho to Timor,"" and the colonial territories became Portuguese provinces. This park for children was meant to teach these ideas. Therefore, one can observe miniatures of the main Portuguese monuments -- Belem Tower, Jeronimos, Batalha, Univerity of Coimbra, etc. -- along with showcase pavilions of all Portuguese colonies from Angola to East Timor. Despite the chance of these pavillions to places for independent Portuguese speaking countries, the old colonial odor is still around. Moreover, the area has not any good restaurant or primary amenities, trying to sell what is old and odd. My kids didn't enjoy it after taking some pictures in miniature houses from Alentejo. We won't return.","The nostalgia of Portuguese Salazar colonialism for kids","2019-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/a9/98/c1/ivocarneiro.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/a9/98/c1/ivocarneiro.jpg","27","0","0","4","0","68","0","99","2020-01-06T20:07:05-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.C832EB57A7C684650045C084CB3B74BF","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","C832EB57A7C684650045C084CB3B74BF","664891","Macau, China","ivocarneiro","en","false","2020-01-26T07:46:51-05:00","1","This place is absolutely hilarious, it was built during the fascist regime and you can clearly tell, it’s extremely neglected, maintenance is an absolute disgrace, they probably haven’t done any since the fascist regime 😂 the people who give this place a good review have probably never traveled anywhere.

So while you potter round the East Timor, Macau, African or South American pavilions (or, more entertainingly, the reduced-size Portugese houses of all eras) you get some nice collectables to look over, or a playground, ice cream concession or kids film about Vasco da Gama.

It is located at the end of the main pedestrian street, next door to the City Hall behind an ornate Romanesque-Manuelino facade.
The complex dates back to 12-13 century when Coimbra was the nation's capital, while Manuelino decorations were added later in 16 c.
For a very cheap entry fee of few Euros you can visit the entire complex: Church with amazing Azulejos decorations, Monastery and cloisters, sacristy and elevated choir stalls which were moved on the second floor to make space for tombs of Portuguese first two kings on the ground floor by the altar, part dedicated to St. Anthony who spent part of his life here,...etc

Azulejos on the Bible in the Church, one of the best examples of the genre. In the Main Chapel of the temple there are tombs of the first kings of Portugal Afonso I the Great and Sancho I. The tombs, which combine elements of Gothic and Renaissance, were made in the XVI century by Nicolau Chanterin, who also worked in the old cathedral.

I must emphasize I climbed many towers all over Europe, and this one by far has the narrowest staircase I've ever seen. In the upper part it is impossible to bypass other visitors, therefore they have staff at the bottom and at the top which communicate when people can go. For that reason people with claustrophobic and mobility issues should avoid it.

The tower has always had an important role in the University life, due to the frequent sign sounds from its four bronze bells. You can even climb to its top!

For anyone thinking of trying it, however, it is worth knowing beforehand that it is not only a tough climb but also the stone spiral staircase is very narrow and in places a bit claustrophobic. The staff make sure that nobody has to pass each other on the way up or down, which would be impossible, so there is no need to worry about that, but still it would be challenging for anyone uncomfortable in narrow spaces.","Great view, challenging climb","2019-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0a/b2/44/29/john8tea.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/b2/44/29/john8tea.jpg","21","0","2","12","29","7","0","40","2014-06-11T21:46:34-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.91D1BB577BA888CC7F46031F5236821D","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","91D1BB577BA888CC7F46031F5236821D","298207","Fukuoka, Japan","john8tea","en","false","2019-05-23T06:15:59-04:00","5","Just an amazing complex with a stunning massive courtyard that has an infinity edge look down the mountain and river.

So, visiting its University is one of the best things to do for visitors.
However, have in mind the complex is huge, occupying several blocks on a hill.

Other parts you'll see when walking the area towards the square, but they're not of tourist interest and look underwhelming, like Sovietish massive ugly block buildings - that's Salazar legacy.

In the library both the ancient books and bookshelves were very impressive. Some of the books were open, so the quality of the print could be seen. But there was a spoiler: too many of us were in there, despite the fact that we booked our visit to a predefined time slot. Many of the tourist were just pushing and tossing others...

The Saint Michael chapel, although interesting, was less impressive than most of the magnificent churches we visited in Portugal.

But the main building was indeed worth a visit: the massive stairs leading to the entrance, the Armory, the Great Hall of Acts, they were all fantastic. Our way led us to another building in the corner and behind the tower - it had a nice patio and there were the classrooms.

Outside, in the vast courtyard, we saw a class of joyful, freshly graduated students who were celebrating that milestone in their lives!","A university with a great history","2018-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0f/61/fa/d8/seekingtruequality.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/61/fa/d8/seekingtruequality.jpg","170","0","0","8","267","36","0","214","2017-05-04T04:51:37-0400","Seeking True","Q","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.4FCC5A7766791FC81429D6A8AC465676","en_US","0","Seeking True Q","0",,"user","4FCC5A7766791FC81429D6A8AC465676","4","Europe","Seeking True Q","en","false","2018-12-18T03:55:31-05:00","5","This place is very, very nice!

A beautiful statue of Saint Isabel, that is carried in procession during the great festivities, stands at the top of the church. The baroque gilded woodwork, the paintings, the magnificent gothic stone tomb of the Holy Queen and the row of 76 chairs, among other art works are certainly worth a visit.

Imposingly on high, it makes for an impressive approach and entrance through the grand gateway. From the grounds we had panoramic views across the river to the university and old town.

Baroque is the predominant style of the fine church. With a grand nave the view is taken to the exquisite altar, highly ornamented in gilt.

The cloisters are delightful. Decorative arches and columns surround a two storey tranquil space with lovely greenery. A soaring sculpture with a holy figure atop embellished with halo is impressive.","Fascinating origins","2019-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/97/ed/67/permia.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/97/ed/67/permia.jpg","3053","0","324","81","20051","541","0","3676","2006-08-30T17:27:06-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6CEAD20CEAA37AFB28EA1D16E38937C5","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","6CEAD20CEAA37AFB28EA1D16E38937C5",,"Ireland","permia","en","false","2019-04-24T08:05:27-04:00","5","We climbed up here on foot from the old Monastery and so glad we did as it was exhilarating and an opportunity to take photos on every turn if the road.

The church is high ceilinged and the body of Queen Isobel is in a silver casket behind the altar.  Next up are the cloisters which are stunning especially the gardens even at this time of year.

Coimbra, Portugal 

2 Saints...2 Monasteries! 

Santa Clara and Santa Isabel meet here, in history, on this great Monasteries, let's find out how was and why was this encounter:
Coimbra, located in the very heart of Portugal wasn't included in the original schedule of our long-time planned and long gastrotour of (almost) all Spain and north of Portugal. Originally I set our route, from Porto to Seville, via Salamanca, but everything changed when I founded ”Atrio Restaurant & Hotel”, another interesting high-end gastronomic destination, unknown to me, in Caceres. When I was revising, for ”enesima vez”, my homework notes for our route, I found that this ”Atrio” with its alluring 2 Michelin Stars, its great comments on TA and other sources, was a place that can't be overlooked in our agenda...I rerouted, via a mandatory stop in Caceres, our way to Sevilla. 
Then I founded Coimbra, an interesting place that once was Portugal’s capital city, right in our way, from Porto to Caceres...before heading to Sevilla and to Madrid, final destination of our cherished Gastrotour 2018  
So...after visiting all Porto attractions and enjoying its gastronomic adventures, from its fantastic restaurants, we were off to Caceres’s ”Atrio”. As it was a long way, we planned our mid-way stop in Coimbra, but we had a late start on Porto after our great last dinner there...regrettable that circumstance shortened our time to be dedicated to beautiful Coimbra, but that would be a nice excuse to be back soon to better enjoy it  
Within our short time I decided to visit just one of its attractions and we selected the ”Santa Clara Convent” or ”Mosteiro de Santa Clara-a-Nova” in keeping its proper original name in Portuguese. 
The main reason to our selection was its easy access, in and out, in our way to Caceres, but besides it has an interesting and close historic relation connected with the important figure of Santa Isabel of Portugal...that adds 2 Saints there. 

When ”Santa Clara a Velha Monastery” was first built it had difficulties because of its closeness to the Mondego River and the frequent floodings from it. A conditions that worsened throughout the times. Because of those continual floods, King John IV order the construction of a new monastery called ”Santa Clara a Nova”. Most recent, the recovery works, carried out in the building, led to the discovery of many archaeological interesting traces. Because of this finding, this national monument, now has revitalized the space and its History.
Regarding the Creation of Santa Clara Convent itself, the first building of the monastery was founded in 1286, but the Santa Cruz monks opposed to the existence of a new feminine monastic house and it was closed a few years later. However, by early 1300, Isabel of Aragon (burned in Zaragoza Spain) reopened the monastic house and the nuns returned to Coimbra.
Isabel was a Dowager Queen; a widow of a previous ruling King. After king’s D Dinis death, Isabel retired to the monastery, now better known as the ”Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha”, which she had founded -in 1314- in Coimbra. Then she joined the Third Order of St. Francis, devoting the rest of her life to the poor and sick. Even during the great famine in 1293, she donated flour from her cellars to the starving people in Coimbra. She was also known for being modest and humble in dressing and conversation, for providing lodging for pilgrims, distributing small gifts and educating the children of poor nobles. All in all Isabel was a great benefactor of the needs in Coimbra. For those qualities, her charitable nature, and her devotion -to her faith- she was canonized -as Saint- in 1626...that close and important is her story and her figure  to that Monastery and the city. 
It had a Consecrated Church, a hospital welcoming poor people, a Manor House, where Queen Isabel resided, like a dowager, and its own cemetery. 
After parking our car on its large parking areas, when we first entered the immediate Square, fronting that complex, the Santa Isabel statue, erected in the left side of that entrance...caught our immediate attention. It's a simple work -as herself- but gracefully dressed all in white, overlooking the river at his beloved city, like protecting and blessing it...as you can see in our pics 
We couldn't access the complex areas itself, as they were closed that day, but we got important info from one of its friendly staff members entering to it. 
We learned that the well-preserved Gothic ruins of the old monastery (a Velha) were nearby, down the road access to this ”newer” (Nova) one. 
The complex seems -to my old architect eyes- as interesting, as the histories involving it. An example of these details was founded by us at its different entrance door...including the one to parking areas (see pics) 
Anyway, Coimbra merits another longer visit, which would be an excuse to return soon to explore its many enchantments. 
Because of Its historical and architectural importance -this Complex- was declared a Portugal National Monument in 1910. 
I need to note -and clarify to avoid confusions- that this complex visited by us was the ”Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova” (Mosteiro de Santa Clara-a-Nova...in Portuguese) that was built to replace the mediaeval Monastery of ”Santa Clara-a-Velha”, located nearby, which at those time -as mentioned- was prone to frequent flooding by the waters of the Mondego river. 
”...A Nova” in Portuguese means a New Place or New one 
”...A Velha” in Portuguese means an Old One or the Old one","2 Saints...2 historic Monasteries!","2018-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/48/ca/8a/acasasnovasg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/48/ca/8a/acasasnovasg.jpg","118","0","67","34","2949","243","0","395","2013-10-29T22:05:21-0400","Antonio","C","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.26A342960BFA772476C2EB210E1E5293","en_US","0","Antonio C","0",,"user","26A342960BFA772476C2EB210E1E5293","34282","Heathrow, Florida","Antonio C","en","false","2018-10-02T13:02:14-04:00","4","A must visit monastery.

It's a most beautiful space to sit down, meditate and relax.
Don't forget to visit the choir, with the beautiful and original stone tomb, and, next to the church, the huge cloister, the biggest in Portugal, as I read somewhere.
It was a pleasure as I heard mavelous gregorian music in the background. All was quiet and peaceful! I had the whole place for myself. I felt very sorry not having taken the tour...
I will certainly come back here

From the outside this doesn't look like very much, apart from the amazing views of Coimbra, but from the inside it is stunning. Its beauty, historical significance and marvelous art and workmanship are just breathtaking.
As I have been told, it is the largest visitable cloister in Portugal. Due to the brutal wildfires their suppliers lost all plants; therefore, they had no flowers in the garden.
The craftsmanship of the upper choir must be magnificent. We had no chance to visit it, because it will not be regularly visitable before April 2018.
Take your time to visit the monastery and enjoy the beautiful and peaceful gregorian music as it seems there are still nuns in the monastery.
One does not need to be a Christian to visit this monastery, but only someone that appreciates a masterpiece of 17th century art.
But if you are a Christian, you may also pay veneration to Queen Saint Isabel, since her both beautiful tombs are here.","Well worth a trip.

That set us of  to the Santa Clara a Nova to see the coffin of Santa Isabella. The church itself is very interesting as is the silver coffin but do the cloisters as well which is the highlight. The original tomb from the old convent is there behind locked doors as well as documents and artefacts. The cloisters are serene and beautiful. The story concludes with the tragic killing of Ines de Castro at the Park behind the old convent. It is possible to piece together the whole saga by visiting the three sites.

The Almedina Gate (also called City Gate or Arch Gate) was the main gate within the city walls and was at the lowest part of the city. It was the busiest and most important point of access for both the military and the public. Originally, the gate was between two turrets.

The arch and tower are still present and have some significant historical value.

The current chapel was planned by Marco Pires between 1517 and 1522. The tile floor dates to 1613. The painting on the ceiling, by Francisco F. de Araújo, was completed in the late 1600s.  In 1684 Manuel Ramos built the pulpit. In 1733 the chapel received its organ.

The gardens are beautiful, even though it’s not in its fullest grace. We staid in this hotel for a total of 4 nights. Our first stay was great, so we returned one week after, for my birthday, for another 2 nights. Unfortunately the second time was a bit disappointing. It’s not that something actually went wrong, probably we are just “spoiled” and they didn’t meet the standards we are used to. Even though we mentioned it was a special day we got no small “gift” or even birthday wishes. My husband asked if they could arrange some small cake so that my son ( 2 years old) could sing happy birthday after dinner, which they said they couldn’t, but we could order any dessert from the Menu, which we did. Still, no candle, birthday wishes or anything at all. No complimentary drink, small attention, nothing whatsoever... We are regular travelers and this the first time a hotel ( 5 stars) fails to acknowledge any of our birthdays, or other special dates. 
Still, the hotel staff is courteous and professional, the kitchen is great and the overall experience can be rated between excellent to very good.

Food was very good
Welcome drink every day, pm
The Restaurant tasting menu was exquisite and must visit!

We received a five star quality welcome - the car was parked, the luggage taken in and an excellent check in service that included information about the hotel and the town.

We stayed in the older section of the hotel in Palace Room 2.  The room was spacious and nicely furnished and the beds were made up with quality linen and were very comfortable.  The only negative was the clothes cupboard - it was marked and worn and didn't fit in with the quality of the other furnishings.  The bathroom had a walk in shower which had great water pressure and plenty of hot water.  

We took advantage of the welcome drink we were offered and then dined in the Gastro bar.  The food was lovely and the service was excellent.  

The breakfast buffet offered a good selection and the food was delicious.

The grounds of the hotel are lovely and it is an easy 15-20 minute walk from the hotel into town.","Great place to stay in Coimbra","2019-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/a5/dd/58/ros-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/a5/dd/58/ros-t.jpg","13","0","6","25","4","7","0","45","2014-10-04T20:25:38-0400","Ros","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.3919F7A285EF4B8FBC94B35C83D7FF3F","en_AU","0","Ros T","0",,"user","3919F7A285EF4B8FBC94B35C83D7FF3F","255100","Melbourne, Australia","Ros T","en","false","2019-12-15T11:00:40-05:00","3","So I read and reread all these reviews before booking as they seemed to either praise or sternly criticise. If you’re confused, maybe I can help.

The first impressions are great - large fancy gate, dramatic driveway and that famous facade. We were ushered to pull over and a doorman did park the car. One half of the grand stair case was blocked off - I assume for repairs? 

If you like antique then this is the place for you. The area we were told to visit while awaiting check in is meant to be a lounge but it was more like a museum. There’s historical and then there is museum like. We shrugged this off as we were in the “new section”. On the way to our accommodations we walked past man rooms in the main corridor - I can’t imagine these are great. 

We walked to the end of the corredor, turned and walked some more, and down another corridor... and then another (it’s a strangely long walk) until you reach the Spa section. In reality it’s the conference venue with rooms above. We were then greeted by a huge corridor of more rooms. Our room has a balcony overlooking the gardens and the pool. Sounds Luxe but it was a rather dirty balcony with worn furniture. The room itself had kitch writing on the walls, and the bathroom was a marble museum. 

We went to explore the bar area for their free welcome drinks. It’s also suitably old - and as we discovered - it maches the average age of the patrons. We are 36 years old for reference. It appears as though large tour groups come through there, I would guess most patrons are around 55-65. The gardens are also full of elderly couples taking a stroll.

Breakfast was also a little strange - not the greatest selection and always packed. Service was hit and miss. 

It is on a sports ground, and a convention centre. It’s about 15 minutes walk across the bridge to town. We were quite happy to do this but it’s not a fast stroll. 

Would I stay here again? No - it’s just a bit antique and we felt underaged. We didn’t really see a perk / it’s a walk from town, the gardens are interesting but for all of one stroll, and the service was quite average. The new section does not match the old (not even vaguely) and the strange collection of “art” along the corridor is just bizarre. 

Maybe this is your vibe - if so then great, but next time we will be staying elsewhere.

We had booked a suite that promised :

“This renovated suite has wooden or stone floors, a stone-walled bathroom.”

The idea of staying in an old castle was appealing... Hah! The sofa In the tiny sitting area that comprises a “suite” was basically like sitting on a block of cement.Furniture from home goods.

Floors were carpet, not wood or stone. Bathroom was ordinary. Bed was painfully soft and uncomfortable. Staff just keep repeating themselves about how we were upgraded and we were in the castle wing.
I hear the spa wing is even less appealing.
Their beautiful gardens aren’t lovely at all.
The whole place is run down.

This was well worth the 5 Euros entry fee and was a highlight of our visit to Coimbra.","Excellent tour; see it before it is discovered by the tour groups","2019-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/60/avatar038.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/60/avatar038.jpg","28","0","110","57","13","68","0","153","2005-03-08T00:00:00-0500","Marshall","B","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.74621AD43660C4185A6D34BDFFAE9C5F","en_US","0","Marshall B","0",,"user","74621AD43660C4185A6D34BDFFAE9C5F",,"Lincolnwood, Illinois","Marshall B","en","false","2019-01-05T11:38:49-05:00","3","The seminary is slightly of the main route of most of the attractions of Coimbra.

So this place was used to show the home-sickness of the students after they have finished there degree in the University and had to return back to their families, so allot of students or groups placed there something like a grave stone with their nostalgia carved on, so this place was called the “Penedo da Saudade” – Nostalgia Rock”.
This place is very famous and visited by allot of coaches, with mostly Portuguese retired persons on it.
When you are going to visit this place, take also a walk around, starting in the small park in front, so you can also enjoy the surrounding area from the city, this with view among them you have the Football Stadium / Dolce Vita shopping centre.

Should you take the Almedina Arch instead of walking down all the street up to Largo da Portagem, once you cross the Arch, a series of narrow streets, always uphill, would lead you to the oldest part of the city, where there are two cathedrals. The university is also outstanding, but look for the oldest buildings, not the modern ones which aren´t interesting.  There is plenty more too see in this city, but in case you only have a few hours to spend, I think you can have a general view with these tips.","Strolling around old Coimbra","2017-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","216","0","5","96","370","234","0","548","2015-02-19T16:21:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.A93DC0407E3EE8B7D0B9A7D18C6249F8","es","0",,"0",,"user","A93DC0407E3EE8B7D0B9A7D18C6249F8","187428","Andalucia, Spain","southerntraveller49","en","false","2017-10-10T14:21:35-04:00","5","A landmark for Coimbra, it has a wide range of shops to visit, coffee shops to rest and enjoy some the traditional sweets.

However, there is a misconception supported by a number of reviews that it is Roman. In fact it was built during the reign of D. Sebastio, hence the name, and designed by his architect Filipe Terzi during the period from 1570 onwards. Whilst it was built on the site of the old Roman aqueduct, it is not of that period. Nevertheless it is well worth checking out.","A City Centre Feature, But Not Roman","2018-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/13/f1/ff/42/bsandrs.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/f1/ff/42/bsandrs.jpg","1706","0","393","84","8636","756","0","2546","2013-05-07T08:52:24-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D7DBB2256323FAC1877304D1FB4FBBD1","en_IN","0",,"0",,"user","D7DBB2256323FAC1877304D1FB4FBBD1","186298","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","bsandrs","en","false","2018-08-29T01:22:43-04:00","4","The aqueduct looms over the street very close to our hotel, and was beautifully lit at night.

It can be seen that the bridge is relatively new. It was built in 2006 by engineer Antonio Adam da Fonseca (several bridges in Portugal) and cool Sri Lankan-British architect and designer Cecil Balmond (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Casa da Musica, Porto, CCTV building in Beijing). The bridge cost almost 5 million euros and was built with the money of one of the programs of the European Union. The main feature of the bridge is its bend. in the middle part. The idea is not new, Santiago Calatrava likes to exploit it. The bridge is named after King Pedro I the Hard and Ines de Castro, his favorite, who became his posthumous wife. Ines was killed here in Coimbra. It's funny, but a day ago we were standing near their sarcophagi in the monastery of Alcobaca. And now on this colorful bridge. Perhaps their love had the same bright colors.","Bridge of the cool British architect in honor of the colorful love of Pedro and Inês.","2020-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/10/07/5f/8d/vadimm67.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/07/5f/8d/vadimm67.jpg","2885","0","15","274","7745","571","0","3731","2013-01-01T13:35:13-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.836BAA8786B81033412B950CF5BDA70C","ru_RU","0",,"0",,"user","836BAA8786B81033412B950CF5BDA70C","298501","Murmansk, Russia","VadimM67","en","false","2019-10-12T09:06:24-04:00","4","I went to the bridge at sunset to get some photos.

It is Coimbra’s largest square. Praca do Comercio took its name due to the intense commercial activity that took place there. Surrounded by 18th-century apartment buildings and businesses, it’s not a monumental square , but over the centuries it was literally the “market square” where the people of Coimbra did most of their shopping. Now it is a quiet place to relax at an outdoor cafe.  In a corner is the church of Sao Tiago, one of Coimbra’s oldest monuments. On the opposite end is another church, Igreja de Sao Bartolomeu, which dates from the 10th century but was much altered in a baroque style in the 1700s. The square is lovely and the atmosphere is magical. It’s reached via steps from Rua Ferreira Borges, downtown’s main pedestrian street.","The square with magical atmosphere","2020-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/b1/12/d3/margo7850p.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/b1/12/d3/margo7850p.jpg","1506","0","0","67","0","304","0","1877","2019-04-03T13:32:37-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2A7D5B5800E75345B804708547DD3732","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","2A7D5B5800E75345B804708547DD3732",,,"Margo7850p","en","false","2021-01-06T15:27:46-05:00","4","The name of the triangular square of Commerce speaks for itself.

For example, Rua Azeiteiras is a street of olive oil. The square begins with the squat church of San Tiago, and ends with the church of San Bartolomeu.

It dates back to 17c being much younger than the old Se down the hill from 12 c. Beautiful Baroque facade hides magnificent lavish interiors like in most Portuguese churches.

Its construction began in 1598 by the architect Baltazar Alvares and was completed 100 years later. In 1772 the Marquis of Pombal ordered the transfer of the Episcopal See of Coimbra from the Old Cathedral to this one built as a Jesuit church. There are four figures of Jesuit saints on the facade of the church. In the upper part of the facade, completed in the 18th century, there is a Baroque decoration. The transept and presbytery are decorated with huge, gilded altars, built at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. The choir stalls from the 17th century and a magnificent baptismal font from one of its side chapels were brought from the Old Cathedral. Church with two bell towers and a dome, really worth seeing.","The impressive cathedral","2020-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/b1/12/d3/margo7850p.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/b1/12/d3/margo7850p.jpg","1506","0","0","67","0","304","0","1877","2019-04-03T13:32:37-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2A7D5B5800E75345B804708547DD3732","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","2A7D5B5800E75345B804708547DD3732",,,"Margo7850p","en","false","2021-03-21T10:59:54-04:00","4","Most visitors after having visited the Old University buildings walk down the hill to the Old Cathedral and to downtown. Many walk by the New cathedral without entering it but, in my opinion, it is worth to spend some time visiting this church and paying attention to some very good mannerist and baroque decorative elements. Enjoy!

As there is a mixture of valuable old buildings intermingled with the new ones, it´s not unlikely that you might overlook some interesting spots in this area which are a bit ""hidden"" among other buildings. One of the outstanding landmarks is the new cathedral. The rather classical lines in its facade, especially the lower parts of it might be a bit misleading, as once you enter the temple, the interior is absolutely baroque, despite some classical estructural elements. That evolution in styles is apparently a consequence of the long time it took its construction. This temple might not be the most inspiring compared to other marvelous ones I had the chance to see in my stay in Portugal, but its serene monumentality is quite remarkable.","Deserves a visit","2018-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","216","0","5","96","370","234","0","548","2015-02-19T16:21:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.A93DC0407E3EE8B7D0B9A7D18C6249F8","es","0",,"0",,"user","A93DC0407E3EE8B7D0B9A7D18C6249F8","187428","Andalucia, Spain","southerntraveller49","en","false","2018-07-30T08:03:36-04:00","2","I actually prefer the old cathedral over the ""new"" one.

However, it is located in another building at a distance. We had only 40 minutes left and it was traditional for tourists what to watch and what to sacrifice. We chose zoology instead of chemistry. Still, the scarecrows are somehow more visible. What can you say about the museum? Of course, this is not the German Museum in Munich, which is the best I have yet seen in this area. Connecting history and modernity is not easy. For example, the Japanese in Odaiba focused on modernity and it was also not too organic. The Museum in Coimbra is more about the past. At least its zoological part and tool rooms. It's not the proverbial interactivity, but the lack of an educational part, an explanation of the principles of operation of tools, animal habitats, etc. Science, it's about this. In other words, I didn't have enough science in the science museum. I think this is the strength of the Munich experience.Maybe we didn't have enough time... In any case, the museum may not be the most spectacular, or rather, not the most brilliant part of the university, but it is definitely the most useful.

The first couple of floors are populated by miscellaneous stores dealing in clothes, perfumes and jewelry. Unconventional, but when you think about it it makes sense; people need clothes! Also noticed some stores selling outdated stuff like paper books, but that is surely temporary.

The topmost floor has a small, but interesting selection of fast food restaurants. A Burger King right next to a KFC? I applaud your boldness, Dolce Vita! There’s also a cinema there, but no IMAX. The only flaw in this otherwise perfect shopping centre.

As you might’ve realised by now, Dolce Vita Coimbra is the kind of place where empires are built and babies are made. That’s why they sell condoms in the bathrooms! Babies are expensive!

Highly recommended.

This church is situated outsider of the historical part of Coimbra really on a place you would not expect such a nice viewing church.
To enter you have to walk up by the nice staircase.
Once on the inside you will see the great views made out of “Azulegos” or hand painted tiles on the two side walls, something like you not will see very often, it is more like the entrance from the “São Bento” Railway station in Porto.
We are live already for 14 years in Portugal, and this is the first time that we take some time to visit this place, and we never had imagined that we would see such nice things on a place we passed almost every week.
Beside the church you have two small cemeteries where you can have an idea from how they burry there dead relatives, some normal underground and some above in “Jazigas” or small houses.
So we do hope that our visit to the historical part of Coimbra was some help for you.

Il prend sa source dans les massifs de la Serra da Estrela dans le district de Guarda à 1 360 m d'altitude. À mi-parcours, un barrage contrôle son cours (Baragem da Aguieira, district de Viseu), à l’endroit où il accueille les eaux du Rio Dão et du Rio Cris. Puis, il poursuit sa course vers l’ouest, traversant en chemin les villes de Coimbra et de Figueira da Foz, où se trouve son embouchure sur l'océan Atlantique. A Coimbra, les rives du fleuve Mondego sont réunies par quatre ponts routiers (trois à l’ouest et un au sud de la ville). Le plus ancien (ouvert en 1954), le Santa Clara est facilement visible depuis le chemin de ronde du Palais royal. Une superbe passerelle piétonnière (pont Pedro e Inês) a été ouverte en 2007. De beaux parcs et des aires de stationnement ont été aménagés sur les deux rives entre cette passerelle et le pont Santa Clara : parque Manuel Braga, Parque Verde do Montego, Parque do Choupalinho, etc. Croisière fluviale offerte sur le Mondego près du Parque Manuel Braga.","Le plus long fleuve du Portugal - à ne couler qu'au Portugal","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","1488","0","46","80","5398","337","0","1906","2013-01-16T13:46:43-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","en_CA","0",,"0",,"user","F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","155033","Quebec City, Canada","Michel_Louise_2013","ru","false","2019-09-27T21:07:24-04:00","4","Речка чистая, есть купающиеся.

We stayed for about ten minutes in a couple of unfurnished and insignificant rooms and small cells together with the other people who had access to the library at the same time as us. After this time uselessly spent here, the guided tour continued in the Intermediate Floor of the library. Being a part of the visit to the library this visit cannot be avoided, but certainly it is a part of almost zero interest also because we have not had any explanation in the minutes spent here. It seemed to us more like a place to keep visitors waiting while all those who have a scheduled visit to the library at that time enter and have their ticket checked for validity and time of visit and where to provide the group, when complete, the general rules for the visit.","Uninteresting initial part of the visit to the Biblioteca Joanina","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","196","0","0","16","96","10","0","222","2016-12-04T11:31:32-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","187824","La Spezia, Italy","bluebay06","en","false","2020-01-26T22:12:50-05:00","5","a 2 cell prison from the time that the University had own court.

Motivo:
Nos anos 70 fiz um quadro inspirado numa Revista humorística de José Vilhena, em cuja legenda escrevi:
< tantas vezes vai o cântaro à fonte...>

Como já foi referido por quem faz avaliações/comentários, esta loja merece mesmo várias visitas por quem sente curiosidade em descobrir algo.

Por outro lado, o Sr Jorge Dias é uma pessoa conhecedora do meio (antiguidades, velharias etc)
e extremamente simpático e atencioso.

Parabéns

Są też oryginalne listy - od osób z różnych stron świata, również od ojca św. Jana Pawła II.

Monumento com muito pormenor e elegância. Quem resiste a sentar um pouco ao seu lado? Sobre esta estátua tranquila, já muito e muito bem foi aqui transmitido.  
Tricana era o nome dado, até às primeiras décadas do Séc. XX, às mulheres do povo na região de Coimbra, mas também em algumas cidades do distrito vizinho de Aveiro. Só que a tricana de Coimbra ficou mais célebre, por causa da sua estreita ligação com os estudantes, e as irresistíveis atrações.
As lindas tricanas, simbolizam os amores fugazes e românticos da juventude. Em conjunto com as capas negras e as guitarras apoiam a mística dos estudantes de Coimbra, formando uma espécie de trio divino. Evidentemente que nos dias de hoje já não se mantem na totalidade essa corelação. Ficam os ícones. Que seja.
As típicas tricanas extinguiram-se, mas as mulheres estão cada vez mais bonitas, as capas negras permanecem mas mais em períodos de festas académicas e as guitarras cada vez se ouvem mais. Tempos de evolução.
A figura da Tricana, empresta uma alegria, uma juventude e uma nostalgia que continua a ser cantadas em qualquer Serenata de Coimbra.","Quem resiste a sentar um pouco ao seu lado?","2021-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1d/d2/7b/2a/sir-aiwa-jorge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/d2/7b/2a/sir-aiwa-jorge.jpg","53","0","0","5","0","64","0","122","2019-02-24T22:29:16-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.A152BB02931E231D32EB4FAA4FD139A0","pt_PT","0",,"0",,"user","A152BB02931E231D32EB4FAA4FD139A0","189140","Aveiro, Portugal","Jorge-Sir-Aiwa","ja","false","2020-03-11T21:19:28-04:00","4","石段のある街並みの途中に現れたトリカナ像でキット水汲みの途中で一休みした様子が良く表されたブロンズ像で記念写真のスポットで街並みと一緒に写真が撮れました。","街並みに良く似合うブロンズ像","2020-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/04/74/a4/06/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/74/a4/06/caption.jpg","3347","0","1257","187","11493","349","0","3884","2012-01-17T01:09:28-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8C7756F9205E4B7D12BCDC6E9DB1A487","ja","0",,"0",,"user","8C7756F9205E4B7D12BCDC6E9DB1A487","298102","Chubu, Japan","Discover805018","ja","false","2019-09-27T16:58:39-04:00","4","コインブラのファドセンターの近くにあるブロンズ像です。水道が未発達だった時代、ポルトガルの多くの町は坂が急なので、家事の水汲みが大切な仕事です。そうした仕事を受け持っていたトリカナとよばれる家政婦さんの像です。

The cemetery, like most in Europe, has mausoleums for the more wealthy and paupers graves for the poor.  The only thing they have in common in that the inhabitants are dead.  It is interesting to wander around and the pathways are well maintained.   After a few years the paupers graves are dug up and the bones transported to Coimbra University, which has resulted in the university having the largest human remains collection of any university in Europe.
I had to go here for the funeral of a friend some years back and all of the mourners were appalled at the way the gravediggers loitered very near the grave, smoking, while the coffin was lowered into the ground.  Then immediately in was in, they started to shovel in the soil before the mourners could finish paying their respects.

It was quite slightly interesting with some unusual building styles and mausoleums some of which have clearly not been maintained. These are the kind of places that I find more interesting to visit, and although not big this place was very peaceful and had a great view of the river and the lands yonder and afar... I did reminisce ferociously about the good times and better times of the holiday which in fact is best carried out in such an environments.  There were some figs on the trees but I wasn't tall enough to pick them so you should bring a ladder or at least a chair with long legs, maybe a high chair would do it. There is a small shop nearby which sells gaseosa and other items to eat and drink. Afterwards we went to the town centre where I did eat a poor quality mean and did commence being stared at by a lady of about 89.

From the moment you are entering the front gate, you can see that this is a very special place to visit, very well maintained on behalf of some graves with broken windows and not looked after, this almost certainly because there are no more relatives or they are living abroad as millions other Portuguese’s.
In size it is enormous and even than they have a place like a church on the end, following the main street where they keep the coffins on three levels on next the other, and next this place I had an open door when I looked through it, I saw left and right coffins on wooden supports.
They have in Portugal a totally different way to burry there dead relatives than in other places of Europe.
For my personally It is a really interesting place to visit.

Rui and his colleagues are so easy to talk to and welcoming and we learned a lot.  First, Rui explained that each family in the area has been growing wine for centuries in their backyard. Realizing that many older folks were having trouble continuing the tradition, Rui quit his job to start a winemaking business. The wine itself is extraordinary, the biggest problem was figuring how to fit all of it in our suitcase.  A great day filled with great wine.

Mais do que uma opção de enoturismo, é uma grande oportunidade para vivenciar e conhecer o grande potencial e qualidade dos vinhos da região da Bairrada, com suas próprias características, terroir, e a famosa casta Baga, que produz os potentes e famosos vinhos da região.

Subiu ao trono em 1521, e aí se manteve até à sua morte. Casou com Catarina da Áustria em 1525.
João III, apelidado de ""o Piedoso"" uma das dignidades reais conferidas pelo papa, foi o Rei de Portugal e Algarves de 1521 até sua morte. Está sepultado no Mosteiro dos Jerónimos em Belém, Lisboa. 
O monumento em sua homenagem encontra-se em destaque, num pedestal paralelepipédico integrado no amplo espaço do Pátio da Universidade de Coimbra. Feita em pedra, foi inaugurada em 1948 e  tem 6,90 metros de altura. O Rei surge numa pose formal própria da ideologia da época em que foi esculpida. Extremamente religioso, o que o tornou subserviente ao poder da Igreja, permitiu a introdução da inquisição em Portugal em 1536. A figura de D. João III é tão central na história portuguesa que não oferece um consenso a respeito do seu reinado. É também visto como responsável pelo atraso cultural de Portugal.
 D. João III, não era um monarca particularmente dotado de qualidades intelectuais, nem mostrou dedicação pelos estudos, no entanto foi da sua responsabilidade, em meados do séc. XVI, a fixação definitiva da Universidade em Coimbra, cessando com as sucessivas deslocações da instituição de ensino entre Lisboa e Coimbra. Por isso, a cidade atribuiu-lhe o nome de uma rua numa zona que acolhe diversas instituições de ensino.

There the car is safe and from this place you can do everything what you wanted to see in the city if Coimbra by foot, and do not be afraid to get lost, because this will never happen.
From this location to the “Rua Sofia” it is only about 500 meters, and so you can start with the “Palácio da Justiça”, continue with the “Patio da Inquisição”, return on your steps to see the “Jude’s Fountain”, continue to the street up until the “Praça da Republica”, return on your steps on the other side of the street, so you will see the elevator, next to it the “Public Market”, 200 meters further, turn left and start the visit of the Old town, and you are only about 200 meters from the underground parking.

I biglietti li ho acquistati il giorno prima vicino all'entrata dello stadio nella sede della società di calcio dell'Academica . Il costo per un posto in tribuna centrale era di 10 euro, il prezzo per la tribuna dei distinti era di 5 euro. Lo stadio è situato vicino al centro commerciale Alma Shopping e la squadra dell' Academica di Coimbra ha come supporter gli studenti universitari, molti dei quali con bandiere,  che occupano il settore dei distinti. Lo stadio è ben servito dai bus pubblici. Ne ho preso unoda Piazza della Repubblica. Molti studenti universitari erano presenti ed avevano un abbigliamento simile a quello di Harry Potter. Lo stadio ha una capienza di 30.000 posti. Sono aperti durante la partita solo l'anello inferiore della tribuna centrale e dei distinti. Sono arrivato con un certo anticipo e sono andato all'entrata indicata sul biglietto.Potevo sedere dove volevo . Ho solo domandato se vi fossero dei posti occupati ed alcuni signori mi hanno indicato i posti che erano sicuramente disponibili. La visione della partita era buona malgrado sia presente il campo di atletica. Lo spazio tra file e tra posti era più che sufficiente. Lo stadio è formato da due anelli, superiore ed inferiore quasi completi.La curva alla sinistra della tribuna centrale non ha l'anello superiore ed è così visibile parte del centro commerciale Alma Shopping.
Il tifo dei presenti molto spontaneo ed educato simile a quello italiano di una cittadina di medie dimensioni negli anni 60. 
Gli spettatori in tribuna erano solo qualche centinaio ed arrivavano anche a partita iniziata. Il tifo un pò più rumoroso, con tamburi e bandieroni, proveniva dai distinti. 
Il pubblico è rimasto tranquillo per gran parte della partita perchè la squadra di casa, l' Academica, è passato subito in vantaggio. Dopo la rimonta della squadra ospite che pareggiava il pubblico di casa è entrato in uno stato di agitazione. Grida per sostenere i propri beniamini nella speranza di tornare in vantaggio. Grida vane perchè la partita si chiudeva in pareggio.  Fuga precipitosa degli spettatori al fischio dell'arbitro.
Appena usciti sono andato ad Alma Shopping che è attiguo allo stadio ed ho mangiato in un fast food. 
Ho pagato per una tribuna centrale 10 euro,a Frosinone per una partita di serie B in tribuna centrale si pagano più di 50 euro.","Una partita tra pochi intimi","2019-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/58/37/a0/aldo-d.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/58/37/a0/aldo-d.jpg","2","0","0","6","0","9","0","17","2015-07-20T05:48:04-0400","Aldo","D","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.032921CB56F604D8F5C237FA8BA675E1","it","0","Aldo D","0",,"user","032921CB56F604D8F5C237FA8BA675E1","187791","Rome, Italy","Aldo D","pt","false","2019-05-27T15:18:34-04:00","5","Um lindo estádio, construído junto ao Alma Shoping.

Interessa referir que o financiamento desta ponte não teve qualquer derrapagem:  Foi calculada para 15.000 contos e custou 15.000 contos, apesar dos extras implementados (uma lição para os projetos do Centro Cultural de Belém e da Casa da Música, com derrapagens astronómicas). 
Voltemos à ponte de Santa Clara. em medos do século passado, numa época em que não havia autoestradas, o trânsito da estrada mais movimentada do país, a EN 1, passava obrigatoriamente por esta ponta e assim foi durante décadas. A antiga ponte de ferro estava degradada e foi necessário substitui-la. E assim nasce a Ponte de Santa Clara, inaugurada em 1954.

A Fonte dos Judeus estava originalmente próximo do Bairro Judaico, daí o seu primitivo nome. A referência mais antiga a esta fonte remonta a 1137.

Now there is not much to see in the square and it is a short climb up a narrow street to get there.  It is said that the worn stone in the square was where people were executed, but I doubt this.  What axeman would chop into stone?

A fonte não tem nada demais. Não há placas contando a história e se você não conhecer, você não saberá do que se trata.
Não há placas - aliás- as poucas placas que existem, estão caindo ao pedaços e não indicam nada - indicativas para o tal jardim medieval ( eu nunca encontrei). O lago do bambuzal é um tanque ridículo e o lago da fonte das lágrimas fede de tanta água parada.
Não recomento.

Foi aristocrata de nascença (seu pai era um aristocata cirurgião e a sua mãe de origem de famílias finas).
Foi estudante de Direito e mais tarde professor catedrático. 
Foi fiscal das Finanças.
Foi soldado no Regimento de Coimbra que lutou nas invasões napoleónicas.
Foi primeiro-ministro bastante tempo.
Foi maçon.
Foi liberal anti-absolutista. 
De todos estes cargos e atributos, ficou para a História como o ""Mata-Frades"", por ter idealizado em 1834 a lei promulgada que extinguia as ordens religiosas. No entanto, para se perceber o alcance desta lei, é necessário evidenciar que, desde os tempos da Idade Média, o clero tinha uma força desmesurada mesmo em relação à nobreza e para não falar no povo. Para além de força, o clero dispunha de riqueza exagerada por comparação com o povo, já para não falar nos tempos da Inquisição. Ora, esta atitude de Joquim António de Aguiar teve que se considerar oportuna e uma grande pedrada no charco da imoralidade da distribuição da força e do poder económico. 
Assim, Coimbra, terra natal de Joaquim António de Aguiar erigiu-lhe uma justa homenagem numa praça central, bem iluminada naturalmente, em frente ao Mondego e à Ponte de Santa Clara.","Homem multifacetado.","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/0f/07/4e/joao-l.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/0f/07/4e/joao-l.jpg","1066","0","195","64","2914","212","0","1343","2014-11-19T12:22:03-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.CE8CECD83A50578434EAF23146615D02","pt","0",,"0",,"user","CE8CECD83A50578434EAF23146615D02","580268","Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal","666joaol","ja","false","2020-03-14T22:10:22-04:00","3","コインブラで30分くらいフリータイムがありました。ツアーの集合場所としてこちらの像の下に指定されました。街歩きの起点の様で、ポルタジェン広場にあり、メインストリートのフェレイラ.ボルゲス通りにつながっています。いかにもヨーロッパらしいテラス席のカフェがあり、老舗のお店やおしゃれで落ち着いた店舗が沢山ありました。","ツアーの集合場所","2020-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/08/eb/26/b6/palphy.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/eb/26/b6/palphy.jpg","694","0","28","64","1301","338","0","1096","2014-10-31T11:13:04-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F4E1ED61CD441123DB8E235E3E23BEAB","ja","0",,"0",,"user","F4E1ED61CD441123DB8E235E3E23BEAB","1021149","Sakura, Japan","palphy","ru","false","2019-09-28T01:27:20-04:00","4","Монумент неплохо вписывается в окружающий архитектурны ландшафт.

Pessoalmente, vergo-me e homenageio a enorme criatividade do escultor Alves André que, num relativamente pequeno espaço, conseguiu criar uma pequena obra escultórica tão grandiosa no seu significado. 
Ora, o Fado de Coimbra está associado à música do fado, às serenatas dos estudantes, às vidas boémias, aos amores, aos amantes, aos perplexos, aos desintonizados com a vida real, etc. 
Esta escultura retrata esses sentidos todos. 
Além de tudo, está muito bem localizada, junto à Porta de Barbacã.
Esta é a parte de Coimbra que nunca se esquece.","Palmas à criatividade de um grande escultor.","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/0f/07/4e/joao-l.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/0f/07/4e/joao-l.jpg","1066","0","195","64","2914","212","0","1343","2014-11-19T12:22:03-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.CE8CECD83A50578434EAF23146615D02","pt","0",,"0",,"user","CE8CECD83A50578434EAF23146615D02","580268","Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal","666joaol","ja","false","2019-09-27T17:22:05-04:00","4","バーブリカ門を通り、ファドセンターを過ぎて、アルメディア門のほうに右に曲がるところの左手にあります。正面から見ると、ポルトガルギターと女性が合体した感じですが、後ろの写真を撮っている人が多いので、回ってみると、おしりの形をしていました。人気の理由が分かりました。","人気のスポット","2019-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/cf/f8/23/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/cf/f8/23/caption.jpg","2454","0","16","118","2137","132","0","2705","2012-05-27T04:46:57-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F449890A756C6550C4B42B035CBD7221","ja_JP","0",,"0",,"user","F449890A756C6550C4B42B035CBD7221","1023181","Tokyo Prefecture, Japan","Cruiser804015","pt","false","2019-08-12T02:03:26-04:00","4","Um monumento inaugurado em 2013, um pouco inusitado, especialmente quando visto pela sua parte traseira.

The project Mercearia de Arte Alves & Silvestre pretends to transform the ""status quo"" of the local art market and to alter popular beliefs of lower and middle classes that art tends to be elitist, obscure and inaccessible. Thus, Mercearia de Arte Alves & Silvestre, in a free translation Alves and Silvestre art grocery store, wants to be a contemporary art gallery that demystifies wrong ideas and stereotypes by reaching a wider public and promoting a closer approach to customers. The crosstalk with academia will be stimulated and the interaction with to local art and tourism agents and local community are seen as key factors for the success of this project. A responsible civic action and fostering of local tourism and art will be constants goals, in order to promote artists and their craft not only regionally, but also nationally and internationally. The gallery's mission is to promote contemporary art and culture, based on the exposition of well-established artists with recognized notoriety and consensual value in the inner circle of criticism, but often distant or hardly recognized outside the two major metropolitan and cosmopolitan areas of the country, Lisbon and Oporto. Young artists still in training will also be a priority, facilitating their transition into the professional world. The gallery will present art in all formats, including the application of new technologies and media art, always focused on the internationalization of Portuguese artists, as well as the introduction of international artists to our market. In addition to works of art, the gallery will contain other products (merchandising and art books) related to the artistic and cultural world. Cultural events such as discussions, talks, presentations, workshops and guided tours will be supported in our space, aiming to engage local community in the art market through informed, dynamic, civic and enjoyable activities.",,,"eu.portugal","geral@merceariadearte.com","Europe/Lisbon","1200","900",,,"1320","720",,,"1320","720",,,"1320","720",,,"1320","720",,,"1320","720",,,"1380","660",,,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/de/51/d6/mercearia-de-arte-alves.jpg","false","false","false","false","40.20796","6628855","Coimbra, Coimbra District, Central Portugal","none","-8.41966",,"Mercearia De Arte Alves & Silvestre","4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Open Now","Coimbra","+351 239 820 302","""Chroma"", João Teixeira - Exhibition Opening - 10 to 29 may","0","98456022","400","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/de/51/d6/mercearia-de-arte-alves.jpg","640","343","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/de/51/d6/mercearia-de-arte-alves.jpg","550","400","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/de/51/d6/mercearia-de-arte-alves.jpg","640","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/de/51/d6/mercearia-de-arte-alves.jpg","150","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/de/51/d6/mercearia-de-arte-alves.jpg","50","false","2014-05-15T07:10:45-0400","2014-05-15T07:10:45-0400",,"0","user",,"default","#94 of 108 things to do in Coimbra","attraction","108","Coimbra","189143","94","#94 of 108 things to do in Coimbra","3.5","2.7455291748046875",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"47","Sights & Landmarks",,,,,"#94 of 108 things to do in Coimbra","163","Points of Interest & Landmarks",,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189143-d6628855-Reviews-Mercearia_De_Arte_Alves_Silvestre-Coimbra_Coimbra_District_Central_Portugal.html","http://www.merceariadearte.com","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189143-d6628855-Mercearia_De_Arte_Alves_Silvestre-Coimbra_Coimbra_District_Central_Portugal.html"
