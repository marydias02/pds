A lovely diversion.

Than getting there by itself is very interesting, you have to call them once you are there and they will come and take you by the boat.(I recommend reservations)
Once you are there ,the food is amazing ,simple and fresh and delicious.please order everything seafood on the menu .
Oysters (the freshest and tasty)
Fried eels
Clams,different kinds 
Even the olives tastes very good here.
Lots of good wine , beers, and the red sangria is a must.
This is a family business all the family members work here , the mother cooks here (real tasty simple home made food)
SANDRA she is one of a kind ,always smiling and ready to explain and please the customers.
The father very friendly guy runs the boat service.
Oh I forgot to mention there is even a hammock under the real pine tree to take a nap after few drinks and few dozens of oysters , it’s HEAVENLY!
For me it’s even worth to come to Aveiro only to eat here.
Very good job Sandra.

Since my wife loves oysters, while I usually skip,  I decided to surprise her and noted the name. After strolling through Aveiro for a couple of hours we returned to the car, put the name on the Waze, and to my great surprise shortly arrived to a spot on the water at the outskirts of the village. There was nothing in sight. An old man was sitting in a small car nearby so I approached him. He did not speak a word of English but upon seeing the name in my notebook mimicked to me to wait. He made a phone call and within a few minutes another car arrived. In it was Sandro who politely explained that the place is closed and reservations are usually required. Noting our big disappointment and due to the fact that we were on our way to Porto, he immediately decided to host us. He called Sandra's father who manages the small boat, took us to this beautiful place, asked a lovely young man to show us the farm and finally opened the kitchen for us so we could order the most amazing oyster meal. Even I enjoyed these special oysters which my wife claims were the best she ever had.

The Museum de Aveiro has been installed since the year 1911 in the former “Convent de Jesus of the Dominican Female Order”. This convent, who is one of the oldest in Aveiro, dates back to the second half of the 15th century, and got founded by D. Brites Leitão and D. Mecia Pereira.

Princess Joana, daughter of Afonso V, enters this house in the year 1472 and lives a life of sanctity here, leading to her beatification in the year 1693. The prestige of the convent was thus definitively associated with the presence of Princess Santa Joana and her cult religious.

The Museum of Aveiro presents a visiting circuit with two distinct parts: the monumental route and the permanent exhibition.

On the ground floor of the convent, the tomb of Santa Joana Princes, the Church of Jesus, the cloister, the chapter room and the refectory stand out.","Visiting the city of Aveiro.","2021-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","1686","0","133","166","8759","222","0","2075","2011-09-25T09:37:40-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","1444586","Santa Comba Dao, Portugal","hans-jaguar","en","false","2021-07-30T12:49:29-04:00","4","Beautiful museum and convert.

So if you want to enjoy this kind of breeze...you should really visit my home town. Fish and sea food is what you get from Aveiro very very fresh. The deserts....sweets are confy and sweet ...ovos moles, and all the sweets that come with them....white wine...once we are placed in a wine area that produces a lot of white wine and our champanhe that we call Espumante! Great to families with kids!!You should cross the river in one Moliceiro at the city center...and rent a tuc-tuc or just walk in the center to see the views.

La pianta è insolitamente esagonale e la sobrietà e semplicità delle forme architettoniche alleggerisce la parte alta della cappella.

Il prospetto principale è in pietra locale (ançã) sormontato da un campanile centrale, mentre il portale è fiancheggiato da doppi pilastri e sormontato da trabeazione toscana.

All’interno altari laterali e l'altare maggiore della prima metà del XVIII secolo XVIII, mentre la sagrestia è rivestita con piastrelle bianche e blu come la cupola.

It thus constituted one of the most important and largest geographical features of the Portuguese coast. On the ria you can enjoy your visit by making a tour on a riverboat who shows you around also the salt winning area.

Along the Atlantic Coast, the ""Ría de Aveiro"" - a lagoon and a few shallow canals - runs for 45 kms in lenght, with a width, at its largest point, of 11 kms. The lagoon was formed, in the 16th century, as a result of a sea retreat and, some time later, by the construction of coastal cords which originated the lagoon. The best way to visit the ""Ría de Aveiro"" is taking a tour, on one of the many traditional boats - the ""Moliceiros"". These boats were originally conceived for the collection and transport of the ""moliço"", an acquatic plant used as a fertilizer. They are painted with bright colors and decorated with unique motifs. Ancient salinas, along the lagoon, used to produce ""Flor de Sal"", a quite expensive and disputed salt variety. Evidently, Venice is too far away, but Aveiro is a magic romantic town and deserves a visit by all those traveling in Northern Portugal!

Aveiro it’s a very small town, and the best way to understand the town is to take the Molicero tour (the boat tour).

If you’re planning to stay in Aveiro for a couple of days it should be the first thing to do. It would give you a good overview of the town. After the boat ride, explore more of the river on foot and at your leisure.

Aveiro has the Ovos Moles, an egg yolk with sugar, sourced from an ancient women's monastery. Its shape is obtained by mixing eggs and sugar patiently and is prepared according to traditional knowledge. After the nuns disappeared, the recipe passed from generation to generation and is preserved to this day.
► I thought it would be nice to see how the pastry is made so I signed up on the website in advance.
► The workshop is located on the main street near the main canal.
Our group included our family and group of young and cheerful students visiting Portugal.
The cute guide told us in excellent English about the history of the pastry and made most of it in front of our eyes. She even let us help a little bit.
In the end, we tested one. We didn't really like it: too sweet, lots of filling in thin dough. Well... everyone and his own taste...
► The bottom line: Although we will never prepare Ovos Moles at home, the workshop itself was interesting, nice and funny!","Oficina do Doce - Ovos Moles Baking Workshop","2019-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","52","0","6","25","2","40","0","117","2013-07-16T05:05:31-0400","Suzi","S","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.1088685974AAE6DC7175698C4BA853C2","en_US","0","Suzi S","0",,"user","1088685974AAE6DC7175698C4BA853C2","293984","Tel Aviv, Israel","Suzi S","en","false","2019-08-29T04:51:24-04:00","5","A nice place to stop and learn more about the history of ""ovos moles"".

In the year 1834, the convent was turned into a military barracks, and consumed by fire a few years later.

The facade is fantastic and it has an elegant campsnile beside it, a decorative cross out front and a pleasant paved square.
Inside it is largely whitewashed walls with decorative tiles lower down 
The alar is nice, a greenish hue with gold gilt. There's a nice window above the altar that affords copious amounts of light

Il aurait été assassiné par balle en Espagne par des membres de la police politique portugaise. Ce carrefour giratoire construit au-dessus du canal d’Aveiro (le pont marque en fait la limite entre le canal central et le canal do Côjo) est un point stratégique de la ville d’Aveiro pour les visiteurs en auto car il est situé à proximité des autoroutes (A25/IP5 et N235) ainsi que du centre commercial Forum Aveiro et de son stationnement souterrain. Une grande partie des attractions touristiques de la ville sont situées de part et d’autre du canal. De plus, de très beaux exemples d’édifices Art Nouveau qui font la réputation internationale d’Aveiro pour le Portugal sont facilement visibles depuis le pont de la Praça Humberto Delgado, juste en face, sur la rua Joâo Mendonça, aux nº 24 et 25 (Édifice de la Maison des Ovos Moles), aux nº 11 et 13 (Musée de la Cité) et aux nº 5, 6 et 7 (Édifice de la Coopérative Agricole). C'est aussi depuis ce point d’observation que l’on a la plus belle vue sur l’ancienne capitainerie du port d’Aveiro.","Épicentre touristique de la ville d'Aveiro","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","1488","0","46","80","5398","337","0","1906","2013-01-16T13:46:43-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","en_CA","0",,"0",,"user","F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","155033","Quebec City, Canada","Michel_Louise_2013","es","false","2019-10-27T00:27:11-04:00","4","Dando un paseo a pie o desde un Moliceiro, da igual, la plaza es muy bonita, probablemente una de las mejores fotos de Aveiro.","Precioso sitio...","2019-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/19/7f/39/20/carbonell.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/7f/39/20/carbonell.jpg","1367","0","201","93","581","459","0","1919","2008-06-02T09:09:28-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E1513B76A585656B0207174C6D24ADD7","es","0",,"0",,"user","E1513B76A585656B0207174C6D24ADD7","187514","Madrid, Spain","Carbonell","ja","false","2019-09-28T00:44:31-04:00","3","中央運河の上にあるラン・アバウトになっている橋の上にある広場です。近くには船着き場があり、客引きが多いです。橋の欄干の上には４体の銅像が立っています。","橋の上にある広場","2019-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/cf/f8/23/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/cf/f8/23/caption.jpg","2454","0","16","118","2137","132","0","2705","2012-05-27T04:46:57-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F449890A756C6550C4B42B035CBD7221","ja_JP","0",,"0",,"user","F449890A756C6550C4B42B035CBD7221","1023181","Tokyo Prefecture, Japan","Cruiser804015","ru","false","2019-09-19T20:15:26-04:00","5","Площадь красивая, центральная, живая и динамичная, через которую проходит и наземные, и водные пути!","Одна из центральных площадей","2019-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/10/c0/ab/d7/olegkrylov.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/c0/ab/d7/olegkrylov.jpg","1984","0","0","178","3551","345","0","2508","2016-03-15T13:12:31-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FDDA7CEDA99453B8FF5A0FA4C427C6CB","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","FDDA7CEDA99453B8FF5A0FA4C427C6CB","298518","Ufa, Russia","olegkrylov","fr","false","2019-09-14T05:14:09-04:00","4","Cette place est située en plein centre de la ville d Aveiro juste à proximité du forum où il est possible d y faire du shopping.

Παλαιότερα εδώ κρεμούσαν λουκέτα, αλλά αποφασίστηκε να τα αντικαταστήσουν με κορδέλες, για λόγους προστασίας της γέφυρας.

I checked out quite a few and they all charge €13 for adults and €8 for students for a 45 minute spin.
Much if the canalside is walkable too though if you prefer that, but the boat cruise is with doing too.
The canalside has sone beautiful buildings and you pass under some lovely bridges. A very relaxing experience and the canal will doubtless be the highlight if any trip to Aveiro.

Η επίσκεψή σας κατά μήκος του Canal Central de Aveiro μπορεί να γίνει και με τις χαρακτηριστικές πολύχρωμες βάρκες moliceiro, με τις οποίες διοργανώνονται κρουαζιέρες στα κανάλια της πόλης.

It will presumably reopen at some point but don't know how you can check if it is open before travelling.

Building looks fab from the outside so hopefully the work will be finished soon. Rating is because a simple update on the website and a sign outside would be helpful.

The museum occupies the whole house, having miscelaneous contents but related to that Art Nouveau era, plus a small auditorium were videos are shown and a nice cafeteria in the back yard. The house has a graceful façade, being the house more remarkable than its contents, in my opinion at least. Tickets are cheap -the facilities are quite small- and combined with the Municipal Museum. One remarkable point is that this museum is located in an area dotted with many Art Nouveau buildings. As most of them are private houses, they aren´t really monumental, but cute of course they are, so the area deserves a pleasant stroll and some fotos, as it´s attractive for those who are into this type of art .","Nice place to go if you are visiting the city","2018-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","216","0","5","96","370","234","0","548","2015-02-19T16:21:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.A93DC0407E3EE8B7D0B9A7D18C6249F8","es","0",,"0",,"user","A93DC0407E3EE8B7D0B9A7D18C6249F8","187428","Andalucia, Spain","southerntraveller49","en","false","2018-05-07T07:11:27-04:00","3","The service is not so good, the cakes were not fresh at all, and it's all a bit pricey.

A antiga Ponte dos Carcavelos sobre o Canal de S. Roque em Aveiro, era simples, rudimentar e pouco sólida. A atual Ponte dos Carcavelos, também conhecida por ponte dos Namorados, é uma das muitas pontes de bela arquitetura que pode apreciar na Ria de Aveiro. Existem 3 boas formas de visitar a ponte dos Carcavelos. Uma é passeando a pé no parque de São Roque. Também o pode fazer a pé, passeando pelo tradicional bairro da Beira Mar . A outra forma é fazer o passeio de moliceiro, e assim percorrerá também os outros canais da cidade.","Ponte dos Namorados","2021-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1d/d2/7b/2a/sir-aiwa-jorge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/d2/7b/2a/sir-aiwa-jorge.jpg","53","0","0","5","0","64","0","122","2019-02-24T22:29:16-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.A152BB02931E231D32EB4FAA4FD139A0","pt_PT","0",,"0",,"user","A152BB02931E231D32EB4FAA4FD139A0","189140","Aveiro, Portugal","Jorge-Sir-Aiwa","es","false","2021-07-21T01:28:41-04:00","5","Era el punto de unión entre las salinas ylos antiguos almacenes de sal, inicialmente era un puente de madera que fue sustituido por el actual.

Ricorda molto i mercati dei paesini italiani ed europei di decenni fa…per intenderci nulla a che vedere con quelli vasti e ""ricchi"" del nord Europa o delle grandi città italiane.

Achei  que seria uma visita muito interessante (como por norma são as visitas aos centros ciência viva).
A visita à Fábrica neste momento está mais pobre do que habitualmente, por culpa das contingências atuais (não tem a exposição permanente, porque era interativa/manipulative e está mais limitada nos workshops que apresenta pelas restrições de distanciamento e higienização de espaços e materiais, mas ainda assim acho que vale a pena!
Em visita a Aveiro, fomos lá com os miúdos fazer dois ateliês - construir e programar um robot de Lego e  cozinha com ciência -elaboração de gelado.
Os miúdos adoraram e já pediram várias vezes para voltar.
Os monitores são divertidos e têm jeito para apresentar a “ciência das coisas” aos miúdos.
Apesar das dificuldades atuais a Fábrica está a tentar reinventar-se e criar novas experiências que sejam viáveis nas exigências do contexto atual.
Neste momento, antes de fazer uma visita, aconselho a ligar previamente para se informar das atividades disponíveis e respetivos horários.
Aproveito para dizer que (especialmente para quem gosta deste tipo de visitas, existe o cartão circuitos ciência viva (ronda is 40-50€) que permite a entrada em todos os centros ciência viva e descontos em parceiros como museus, restaurantes, alojamento...) durante 1 ano e é para o casal ou casal e filhos. Torna-se vantajoso para quem tem centros destes relativamente próximos e quer explorar as suas potencialidades com os miúdos.
Resumidamente recomendo a visita!

Μετά το θάνατό της αγιοποιήθηκε, ενώ έχει ανακηρυχτεί από το 1965 προστάτιδα αγία του Aveiro. Το άγαλμα είναι φιλοτεχνημένο από το γλύπτη Helder Bandarra, ο οποίος γεννήθηκε στην πόλη του Aveiro. Αρχικά, είχε τοποθετηθεί σε άλλο σημείο της πόλης από το 1987, για να μεταφερθεί στη σημερινή του θέση το 2001. Είναι κατασκευασμένο από χαλκό, έχει ύψος τέσσερα μέτρα και στηρίζεται σε βάση από ασβεστόλιθο.

Son titre de princesse lui a été conféré à la mort hâtive de son frère aîné Jean. Elle a d’ailleurs joué le rôle de régente en 1471 quand son père participa à une expédition militaire à Tanger. Elle retourna toutefois au statut d’Infantes à la naissance de son frère cadet Jean II, le futur roi du Portugal mais la population portugaise continua de l’appeler « Princesse Joana ». Après avoir refusé plusieurs offres de mariage, elle entra au couvent des dominicaines d’Aveiro où elle mena une vie de sainteté. Elle a été béatifiée par le pape Innocent XII en 1693 ce qui fit du couvent de Jésus (Convento de Jesus) un symbole fort du patrimoine religieux portugais. Bien qu'elle n'ait pas été canonisée, elle est connue au Portugal sous le nom de « Princesa Santa Joana ». Sa statue de bronze est située au centre de l’avenue qui porte son nom (Av. Santa Joana) juste en face du couvent de Jesus qui abrite depuis 1911 le très beau musée d’Aveiro et de la cathédrale Se d’Aveiro.","En hommage à un symbole fort de la foi catholique portugaise","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","1488","0","46","80","5398","337","0","1906","2013-01-16T13:46:43-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","en_CA","0",,"0",,"user","F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","155033","Quebec City, Canada","Michel_Louise_2013","pt","false","2019-09-06T15:35:12-04:00","4","Esta estátua em bronze, da Princesa Santa Joana, da autoria do escultor Aveirense Hélder Bandarra, está em perfeita sintonia no espaço físico.

A casa barco é espaçosa, duas suítes e uma sala, com um solário no deck acima, acessível por escada interna.

Equipada minimamente, apenas o básico de cozinha. Sem Xícara para chá, sem chaleira para esquentar água, sem frigideira.. 
Esponja da cozinha em estado lastimável, não servia para limpar o chão.

Um dos quartos foi invadido por formigas no período noturno, forçando aos hóspedes do quarto invadido a interroperem o aeu descanso na tentantativa de limpeza e retirada das formigas das malas, cama etc... Desgastante

Ao amanhecer este casal amigo com a aniversariante, partiram, encurtando a estadia programada, ficando apenas um casal.

Para valer o preço que cobram, tem que melhorar muito.

Από το 1995 λειτουργεί ως συνεδριακός και εκθεσιακός χώρος, φιλοξενώντας εθνικά και διεθνή συνέδρια, συναυλίες, εκθέσεις, συναντήσεις εργασίας, συζητήσεις και θεατρικές παραστάσεις.","Νέα ζωή για παλιό κτήριο","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","1692","0","0","37","200","240","0","1970","2017-10-17T08:56:35-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","189432","Paros, Greece","Saltpilgrim","pt","false","2022-06-12T19:02:21-04:00","4","Passeando pela Ria de Aveiro, com o moliceiro, se vê este belo prédio que parece uma indústria, mas a guia nos contou que é o Centro de Congressos de Aveiro.

Viewed from a distance, the small village almost looks like it has been hewn out of the mountain rock. The small whitewashed church stands in stark contrast to the rest of the village, that was constructed from the earthy brown metamorphic rock found in this region.

The last residents abandoned Drave in 2009, likely seeking a more comfortable existence elsewhere. The village had no electricity, sanitation, running water, telephone service or mail service, so the residents were truly ‘living off the grid’ before it was seen as a trendy alternative lifestyle. But the location appealed to the Boy Scouts organisation, which uses the village as a base camp. Several of the buildings are now used for camping – by scouts as well as hikers who are passing through. A toilet facility has even been constructed a short distance from the village and water can be collected from the stream that passes nearby.

Now referred to as Aldeia Mágica (Magic Village), Drave is on the tourist map for hikers. Hiking trail PR14 connects Drave to the village of Regoufe, about 4km away. Several websites claim that the trail from Regoufe is the only way to reach Drave. One could be forgiven for thinking that they are conspiring to keep non-hikers away from the village, because I discovered that there is, in fact, an easier way to visit Drave. You can drive there!

When I was planning a route to Regoufe, for the hike to Drave, my GPS navigator showed a road that went directly to Drave. Past experience has taught me that ‘roads’ on a map can be rough trails that are difficult to ride, but it was worth exploring. I plotted a direct route to Drave, but was prepared to detour to Regoufe, if necessary, and hike in.

The 94km between Porto and Drave can be covered in 1 hour 45 minutes. The first segment of the route uses the A1 and A32 motorways but nicer riding-roads begin after leaving the motorways and joining the N224-1. Before long, I was on narrow mountain roads enjoying gorgeous scenery. I love riding in the Magical Mountains – one of my favourite places to ride.

The narrow road to Drave is off Estrada EN1123, after passing through the village of Coelheira. It is a dirt and gravel road, advertised by white paint markings on an adjacent wall for Drave and Gourim. The track has some steep hills as it begins its descent towards Drave. Part way along the track there is a stone marker at a Y-junction. Left for Gourim and straight on for Drave. The track is only wide enough for one car to pass. As it gets closer to Drave, the descent gets steeper with several hairpin turns. I’d made the right decision to take my BMW adventure bike, as it is much better suited for the terrain than my Honda CBF. But several standard two-wheel drive cars had made the journey along the track and had parked in a couple of places towards the end. Whilst not advertised online, local residents are well aware of this route, and had driven out to enjoy their Sunday afternoon. The dirt road eventually narrows to a single footpath that is steeper and more rugged than the road. It is too narrow for cars and too rugged for most motorcycles. So vehicles are parked and the last 10-15 minutes must be covered on foot.

The village is split into two sections, on different hills with the mountain stream running between them. Whilst the smaller part is mostly derelict, it does have one intact building that is used for camping with an adjacent area that can be used for cooking and socialising. In fact, at the time of my visit, a group of teenagers had set up a temporary camp there. The main section of the village has more buildings, with more that are available for camping. Most of the buildings can be explored – those ready for campers are not locked but have wooden doors that can be closed. The whitewashed church is locked and inaccessible. The shape and size of some of the buildings suggest that they were used to house animals (goats, perhaps) or were for general storage.

The layout of the village was dictated by the landscape, so buildings have different shapes and are loosely assembled at different heights and different angles, with narrow walkways between them. It’s an interesting place to explore and to imagine what life was like for its previous inhabitants. I was particularly impressed by the footpaths through the village, that were constructed using large slabs of rock.

I visited on a Sunday afternoon in August, so there were more local visitors than might be expected on a weekday. Yet, there weren’t many people wandering around the village buildings. Most of the visitors (about 20) were congregated around a beautiful, shaded pool that is fed by a cascading mountain stream. Picnicking, sunbathing and generally enjoying a peaceful afternoon in the mountains. The temperature in Drave was about 28C (82F). Hot, but still a bit cooler than the 36C (96.8F) temperatures down at lower elevations. I relaxed by the pool for a while to eat a snack and have a drink, before continuing to explore the village.

I spent an hour exploring the village before heading back up the hill to my motorcycle for the ride back to Porto. A visit to Drave could be combined with visits to some of the other attractions in Serra da Freita.","Abandoned Mountain Village","2018-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/60/39/52/morfish.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/60/39/52/morfish.jpg","385","0","131","122","2145","187","0","694","2009-12-28T19:32:10-0500","Craig","M","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.5A8A1CA3BD94D4108BEA5CA83DD96F66","en_US","0","Craig M","0",,"user","5A8A1CA3BD94D4108BEA5CA83DD96F66","189180","Porto, Portugal","Craig M","pt","false","2022-05-05T09:00:59-04:00","5","A Aldeia Mágica, como é assim designada Drave, merece sem dúvida a visita.

La cappella, che risale al XVIII secolo e sorge non distante dal canale di Sao Roque, mostra pianta circolare ed uno stile semplice e “povero”, ovvero costruita in pietra e calce.

All’interno piccolo altare con icone sacre e San Bartolomeo, i cui devoti ricordano la sua forza nel combattere il diavolo. 

Infine una piccola leggenda locale narra che, in presenza di molto vento in città, vuol dire che questa cappella è aperta e si sconsigliano attività rischiose, perché in quel giorno aumenterebbero gli incidenti.","Una piccola cappella...e la leggenda del vento...","2018-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/b1/a9/4c/degustibus67.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/b1/a9/4c/degustibus67.jpg","2439","0","722","125","7393","981","0","3547","2012-08-12T17:41:21-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.15B95D9F2AD8C04FCD2B5BFF2CB7E50D","it","0",,"0",,"user","15B95D9F2AD8C04FCD2B5BFF2CB7E50D","187855","Turin, Italy","DeGustibus67","pt","false","2019-01-04T00:01:32-05:00","5","Bonita capela,muito pequenina,quase nem se dá por ela,nem mesmo com gps.Pequenina,humilde e simpática.Recomendo.","Capela de São Bartolomeu","2018-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/14/fd/df/9f/carlos-s.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/fd/df/9f/carlos-s.jpg","4186","0","0","16","1343","119","0","4321","2018-04-16T05:09:36-0400","Carlos","S","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6D39CC597465FC4D87F2D67EF6CA3598","pt","0","Carlos S","0",,"user","6D39CC597465FC4D87F2D67EF6CA3598","189158","Lisbon, Portugal","Carlos S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"47","Sights & Landmarks",,,"#32 of 61 things to do in Aveiro","175","Churches & Cathedrals",,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189140-d15688150-Reviews-Capela_de_Sao_Bartolomeu-Aveiro_Aveiro_District_Northern_Portugal.html",,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189140-d15688150-Capela_de_Sao_Bartolomeu-Aveiro_Aveiro_District_Northern_Portugal.html"

Terrível acesso ao armazém pela lateral que todos os dias se forma trânsito porque os camiões não têm para onde ir e acabam por bloquear a rotunda em todas as saídas. Ninguém passa.
Quem desenhou este projeto foi claramente alguém que não o sabe fazer. Não ficou nem bonito nem prático a ninguém, como concordam 90% das pessoas. Bem como a expansão das vias de acesso ao centro comercial que ainda hoje não têm iluminação acesa no viaduto.
Ainda se comparam aos maiores centros comerciais do Porto, como em entrevista disse, que só pode ser mesmo para rir.
Fazem a inauguração com 90% das lojas fechadas. 
Espaço de restauração ridículo. Tem de se andar à volta das mesas por não haver corredores específicos para circulação livre.
O novo piso 1 das lojas faz-se de uma ponta à outra num minuto com lojas ridiculamente pequenas.
Num exemplo prático, penso que a Primark do Porto ou de Lisboa deverá ser maior do que o piso 1 inteiro com as lojas incluídas.
Distrito de Aveiro sem cinemas à dois anos e ainda sem prazo de conclusão.
Moradores aguentaram estes anos de ''expansão'' com ruído 24h por dia. Carrinhas e camiões das obras a ocuparem mais de metade dos já poucos lugares existentes para moradores sem garagem. Ainda hoje acontece. Uma compensação seria justa.
Aconselho a deslocarem-se 60km, 70km para verem o que são centros comerciais bem feitos e terminados em metade do tempo.
Concluindo, é um centro comercial que condiz com a cidade de Aveiro, não se podia esperar melhor.","Péssimo centro comercial","2021-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2021-05-27T16:05:11-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.9F947494D14B9685A5A7B9D1B9FABD95","pt_PT","0",,"0",,"user","9F947494D14B9685A5A7B9D1B9FABD95",,,"Joao_viajante_2021","pt","false","2021-12-04T05:09:31-05:00","1","Cumprirem o CRP e não discriminar  as pessoas.

O cinema fechou e a zona de restauração é menor e com menos opções e menos saudáveis. Esteticamente por fora o centro comercial ficou horrível, parece uma box, uma caixa de sapatos e por dentro é mesmo uma caixa de sapatos. Esta completamente despersonalizado, a zona nova é uma sequência de lojas sem nenhum rasgo que a diferencie de qualquer outro centro comercial. Para mim não faz nenhum sentido. O Forum Aveiro é uma experiência, o Glicinias Plaza deixa-me completamente frio. Até o Auchan esta pior, gosto mais do Mercadona. Mal, muito mal. Aveiro pode não merecer um Primark, mas bem merece um CInema.

Na semana passada estava numa fila para ser atendido e 2 seguranças estavam perto de mim a conversar e a observar os clientes que passavam. Ouvi a conversa deles com inúmeros comentários depreciativos sobre os clientes que passavam - proferiam comentários xenófobos, homofóbicos e misóginos. Gozavam inclusive da forma como as pessoas se vestiam e com opiniões obscenas e pejorativas de teor sexual.
Achei deplorante e vergonhoso.
Não obstante, uma vez que jantava na praça da restauração constatei também a passagem constante dos seguranças junto das mesas onde as pessoas jantavam, sempre com ar rude e intimidatório. O que é grave, sobretudo neste período de pandemia onde deveria haver maior distanciamento físico, porque não havia necessidade deste comportamento embora agora eu entenda a atitude depois de ter ouvido o tal diálogo. As pessoas estão a jantar em paz depois de um dia de trabalho e ainda têm que levar com a desconfiança e ambiente persecutório sobre os clientes. É assustador e mais parece um ambiente de ditadura.
Era cliente assíduo do Auchan, farmácia e da MEO, mas a partir deste momento nunca mais vou, prefiro pegar no carro ir a outro espaço comercial em que haja mais educação e nível.","Ambiente constrangedor e intimidatório","2020-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/53/8b/24/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/53/8b/24/avatar.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","2","0","3","2018-04-02T16:44:50-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.75B8A35A46D51FF62F19093DE6CDC0C4","pt_PT","0",,"0",,"user","75B8A35A46D51FF62F19093DE6CDC0C4","189140","Aveiro, Portugal","davsilva86","es","false","2019-08-13T08:58:01-04:00","4","Amplio, bien acondicionado, con parking amplio, diversidad de comercios y buena accesibilidad con vehículos.","Nevera vacía ","2019-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","30","0","0","6","0","106","0","142","2015-06-06T05:17:07-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.402802CC4C51E8A0A294C7E9729C94DE","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","402802CC4C51E8A0A294C7E9729C94DE","187504","Ceuta, Spain","longus2_jsa","fr","false","2019-08-06T14:35:04-04:00","4","Centre commercial chouette pour faire quelques courses ou manger un bon petit plat.

Cette statue a été élevée sur cette place en 1889 pour rendre hommage à José Estêvão Coelho de Magalhães (1809-1862), natif d’Aveiro, qui fut journaliste, homme politique (licence en droit de l'Université de Coimbra) et orateur de renom. Il faisait partie de l’opposition de gauche à la Chambre des représentants. En tant que représentant politique, il obtint du gouvernement la construction à Aveiro d’un lycée (construit entre 1855 et 1860 à l’ouest de la Praça da Republica) ainsi que le passage par Aveiro de la voie ferroviaire reliant Lisbonne à Porto. C’est aussi lui qui fonda en 1841 « The September Revolution », un journal influent de la presse libérale. Prônant des solutions plus radicales que celles préconisées par les partis politiques de l'époque, José Estêvão a été souvent contraint à chercher refuge à l'étranger (en Angleterre et sur l'île de Terceira). Sur le plan militaire, il a participé au débarquement de Mindelo (épisode de la guerre civile portugaise de 1828-1834) ainsi qu’à la guerre de Patuleia (guerre civile au Portugal entre 1846 et 1847) en intégrant l'armée rebelle qui opérait dans l'Alentejo. La statue a été réalisée à Lisbonne par le sculpteur portugais José Simões de Almeida Júnior (1844-1926).","En hommage à un politicien engagé originaire de Aveiro","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","1488","0","46","80","5398","337","0","1906","2013-01-16T13:46:43-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","en_CA","0",,"0",,"user","F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","155033","Quebec City, Canada","Michel_Louise_2013","pt","false","2019-10-22T04:43:14-04:00","5","Bonita estátua de José Estêvão Coelho de Magalhães, jornalista e político,localizada na Praça da República,uma Praça muito pitoresca.","Estatua José Estêvão Coelho de Magalhães","2019-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/14/fd/df/9f/carlos-s.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/fd/df/9f/carlos-s.jpg","4186","0","0","16","1343","119","0","4321","2018-04-16T05:09:36-0400","Carlos","S","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6D39CC597465FC4D87F2D67EF6CA3598","pt","0","Carlos S","0",,"user","6D39CC597465FC4D87F2D67EF6CA3598","189158","Lisbon, Portugal","Carlos S","pt","false","2019-09-12T15:43:10-04:00","4","Esta estátua em bronze, de corpo inteiro, está assente em pedestal quadrangular em pedra mármore.
