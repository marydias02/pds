However, have in mind it's a high tourist area, so you can guess prices in establishments around are higher with lower service quality.

Clérigos Tower opened its doors in 1763, becoming the highest bell tower of Portugal, with over 75 metres. In 1753 the Italian architect Nicolau Nasoni was invited to design and build this magnificent Heritage, considered National Monument since 1910. The famous church was built in the eighteenth century, between 1732 and 1749 and this was the most emblematic work of the architect Nicolau Nasoni. Is one of the most beautiful temples of baroque feature, and a reference in the history of Porto. The Exhibitions allow to discover the history of the Brotherhood of Clérigos, admire pieces from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century, in painting, furniture, jewellery and vestment collections.

The museum is ok and the tour gave a higher perspective of the interior of the church before climbing the tower itself . 
The stairs themselves are narrow as expected but not in a continuous spiral which for me massively helped as usually I get quite dizzy in these situations. There are people descending at the same time so be prepared for that , we had booked the 11.30 slot which was perfect as when we did reach the top the church bells was ringing across the city , part of the tower goes through the bells so if desired you could deafen yourselves by being in the bell room when they rang ! 
Lovely views very cramped up there as other people had stated but I appreciated the experience, I feel like bags should be made to be kept in a locker or a clocke room as the likes of backpacks doesn’t help the small spaces . 
All in all definitely worth a visit .","Worth the visit","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","5","0","0","2","0","5","0","12","2020-01-11T12:21:04-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.07F4E6139D3194ED35DC559D55C045EB","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","07F4E6139D3194ED35DC559D55C045EB","186375","Staffordshire, United Kingdom","Mommafozz84","en","false","2022-12-17T22:21:15-05:00","3","The Clérigos Church is a Baroque church whose peculiar characteristic is to have a particularly tall bell tower, the Torre dos Clérigos. Vaguely inspired by the bell towers that can be seen in Tuscany, with its six floors and 76 meters high, the Torre dos Clérigos, is the main symbol of the city and visible from several points of the same. The decision whether to pay admission to the tower and climb the 240 steps to the top is a personal one.","A 76-metre Baroque bell tower","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","196","0","0","16","96","10","0","222","2016-12-04T11:31:32-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","187824","La Spezia, Italy","bluebay06","en","false","2022-12-01T07:47:37-05:00","4","We saw this church on a walking tour and decided to return and explore in our own time.  As expected, visiting the church is monetized.  You can have a light show experience for several euro, or visit the tower (walk- up only) for another few euro.  I decided to only visit the interior of the sanctuary itself.  There are beautiful frescoes and sculptures, as well as a crypt.  It is worth a visit. The exterior opposite the bell tower is stunning.","Highly Famous in Porto","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/15/6d/f5/8a/ttaylor2u.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/6d/f5/8a/ttaylor2u.jpg","301","0","49","66","335","312","0","679","2008-07-04T19:29:49-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F3A3FAFC668A61ED414C2EBF4E70232E","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","F3A3FAFC668A61ED414C2EBF4E70232E","28934","Illinois","TravelsNTreasures","en","false","2022-11-23T08:24:25-05:00","4","Built in the mid 750's, this baroque tower of the Igreja dos Clerigos church is the tallest in Porto.

The ticket for an adult is E6 and kids under 10 go free. The way everything is organised was very smart. You follow the signs and pass through the church first - I found it very beautiful inside. Then the path takes you to a small gallery room. Then another room with Jesus Christ artefacts. After that you reach to a point where you need to show your tickets and then the proper climbing starts. The stairs were  narrow, so be prepared to wear good shoes and do stops to meet people. Once you reached the top the view was magnificent. Do this tour on a day with good visibility. There is info giving you an idea how tall the tower is. It’s a bit windy up there, so make sure you are dressed properly too. We spent about 30min observing the city from each corner.  A well worth money for what we got! Highly recommend as an extra bit to the main attractions Porto offers.","A beautiful church with a tower","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/a3/1a/c8/desito07.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/a3/1a/c8/desito07.jpg","343","0","30","33","672","161","0","537","2009-06-15T18:21:38-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D4554178B28BD5BA6836A0338DE8F6C7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","D4554178B28BD5BA6836A0338DE8F6C7","186298","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","desito07","en","false","2022-10-16T08:22:00-04:00","4","Advisable to pre-book your visiting time (which usually means you need to come back at a later time that day), as spaces are limited, and so is the space once you get to the top!

The church was beautiful and we really enjoyed taking in the architecture.
However the tower was really quite chaotic, people with bags coming past you and there was no room for them to pass. It's a free for all, no room to get out at the top so I had to queue to get one photo then back to struggling my way down.
Not enjoyable for a bit of a view at the top which you can get for free and much easier at many other spots in Porto.

After climbing to the top, we took a couple of panoramic pictures of Porto, walked back down, and exited the building at roughly 1:30 p.m. in the afternoon.

You’d better REALLY want to see Clérigos Tower and be willing to lose 2.5 hours from your day! My advice is to skip this time suck altogether, see the interior of nearby Ingreja de São José das Taipas for free (which is nearly as impressive and only a 3-minute walk west), and get your stellar city views from the top of the Dom Luís I Bridge instead of this overrated tower.

The tour itself only lasts about 35 minutes but is well worth it; our guide was very entertaining indeed - a great actress! - and the building itself is definitely worth seeing as a whole but especially the stunning Arab room, the last room of the tour. I also really liked the courtroom.

You cannot just wander at your own pace.
The guided tours occur every half hour in a different language each time, and so it might be several hours before the next tour in your language.
In our case, we began queuing at 1050 and could see the signs saying the next English tour was at 1100.  When we finally got to the front, the single person serving took great pleasure in informing us that we had just missed the English tour by three minutes, we were not allowed to catch up or go unaccompanied, and that the next English tour was three hours later at 1400.  
Several visitors ahead of us in the queue had been purchasing tickets for the Portuguese/Spanish tours in half an hour and one hours time respectively, and visitors behind us in the queue had also been after the English version and were disappointed.  Yet the staff hadn’t seen fit to do a queuebusting “Is anyone for the English tour at 1100 please make yourself known” sort of announcement.  So we ended up making other plans for what to do in a rainy day. 
If you do manage to get in, I’m sure it’s very good.  But as above, be warned about the tour timings.  Apparently the language schedule isn’t published in advance, but rather the first ticket sold for a particular time specifies the language that that time slot will be.","Sadly wasn’t allowed in","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/9d/49/c1/chismb.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/9d/49/c1/chismb.jpg","14","0","35","18","12","27","0","59","2007-08-13T01:24:36-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.63BC757E7966A6E91766CFFE1616F8C1","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","63BC757E7966A6E91766CFFE1616F8C1","186370","Bath, United Kingdom","Chismb","en","false","2023-02-21T06:48:52-05:00","5","The former Stock Exchange in Porto is a beautiful building right in the center of the Old Town.The rooms are nicely decorated and the Arabian Room is a piece of art.","Spectacular","2023-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/25/2f/89/4d/88ovidius.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/25/2f/89/4d/88ovidius.jpg","108","0","0","0","128","20","0","128","2016-08-16T06:03:03-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B1372983E3E69E9F2A2F7116CE1DB78C","en_IE","0",,"0",,"user","B1372983E3E69E9F2A2F7116CE1DB78C","186605","Dublin, Ireland","88ovidius","en","false","2023-01-10T06:19:34-05:00","5","An amazing building rich with history.

Sadly, there were non-English speakers on our tour who kept talking in their language.  Perhaps someone in their party knew English and was interpreting which made it difficult to hear the tour guide.  The most impressive part was the last room and some tid-bits of knowledge about government and architecture.  The guide was good.

Be mindful that you queue to buy a ticket which won't get you necessarily on the next tour, you will choose the language when you buy your tickets and they confirm the times available. We bought our tickets around 9.30am and queued for maybe 15 minutes. The next available tour was 10.15am so we went and got a coffee. When you return for your tour don't join the ticket queue but go into the entrance hall (we went in via the exit) then head to the inner courtyard, somebody will check your ticket just as you go through the door to the courtyard. The tour was informative and entertaining. It is worth the 10 euro price. When we came out at around 10.45am the queue for tickets was massive so suggest getting in early. I can't see any advantage to buying tickets on line, as at Oct 22 the online option doesn't let you chose a date and time, you still have to queue to book which language tour you need and check availability.

By the time we reached the till we were told it was full (though the screen didn't update to show 100% capacity). When I queried the system and asked if online booking would have secured an English tour at a time of my choosing, to my surprise the lady working there told me I would still have had to queue to secure a tour in the language I wanted!

How it looks inside I don’t know - it’s a principle for me not to pay entrance fee to God’s house.

Instead I find it more consistent with Christian values to give the amount to the many beggars around.

What do you think?","Give the entrance fee to the many beggars","2022-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1d/07/1d/f2/christian-m.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/07/1d/f2/christian-m.jpg","771","0","127","182","191","578","0","1532","2012-11-10T08:29:56-0500","Christian","M","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8F577E9F9A96B07A165C586BD906CE2B","da_DK","0","Christian M","0",,"user","8F577E9F9A96B07A165C586BD906CE2B","189541","Copenhagen, Denmark","Christian M","en","false","2022-12-17T03:16:41-05:00","4","This Romanesque-style cathedral (greatly altered during Baroque times), very close to the walls that once protected the city, has the evident characteristic of looking like a fortified church given the two square towers, crowned with a dome on either side of the simple facade. The vast forecourt in front of the cathedral is beautiful, which, being in an elevated position, allows an excellent view of the city and the river below. A pillory, standing in front of the cathedral, it may be used to hang criminals on it.

Even though I am not a fan of heights, this was fine.  Beautiful views of the river and of the two cities on either side of it.  Take your time and enjoy it.  As soon as you get to the other side, go to your right to take the cable car to the shoreline.  A short, fun and exhilarating ride for 7E

When we returned to Porto we took the lower roadway.  Even though it is not as stunning a view and somewhat blocked by construction, it gives another view and feel for Porto.  It gets you right into the Ribeira section, which is so much fun. 

Watch out for the trolleys!

Trains leave Porto-Campainha station (if you start grom São Bentão, must change after 5 minutes) every 1-2 hours lF there's no strike! Two types operate: locomotive+carriages or independent 4-cat unit. Usually not many passengers, but take your own snax & drinx. Only facility is WC. Not many stops as it dlowly snakes out of Porto, Douro River den about 50-60 mins after departure, then it follows the river all the way, even to the last Portuguese station. In February there's not much happening in Ragua, some port places are open for expensive tastings and sales, so my stay was just an hour. 
The way back was pleasant too: beer & pastry helped as the countryside slipped by the window. If it's a loco+carriages then tje windows slip open with some effort for photos without reflections.

When we boarded we were given a COVID test.  Unfortunately my friend tested positive so the couple was removed from the ship and booked in a hotel in Porto.  This was the start of their problem with AMA.  After returning to the US they filed a claim for the unused river cruise and the hotel with their insurance company.  The insurance paid for the hotel as it was a ""delay"" on the trip.  We contacted the travel agency to see what AMA would do to reimburse the denied trip.  Finally AMA called our friends and told them that they would not refund the money for the trip.  So our friends are out $10016.00.  They were also told that if they had taken the cruise line insurance instead of a third party that that insurance would have paid.

This tells me that we would never sail on AMA again and advise no one to as well.  In addition after finishing that trip we think it is over priced.  And we are experience river and ocean cruisers.

Tour of stadium is basically someone walking you around and showing you press room, changing rooms etc - you have to pay extra for audio guide and on top of admission price I think this is excessive.  Other clubs we have visited include the audio guide in admission price or have an actual physical person do the tour and give commentary en-route.
Having said all that stadium, cafe and shop are very good.  Would be great to watch a match there.
Cafe onsite very reasonable and good quality snacks and light bites.","Stadium great - tour not so good","2020-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/cd/2b/8d/j099.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/cd/2b/8d/j099.jpg","92","0","103","226","63","84","0","402","2006-01-06T00:00:00-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.72BB24F01BDB345798D76C9BB9AF6543","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","72BB24F01BDB345798D76C9BB9AF6543","187048","Derby, United Kingdom","J099","en","false","2019-11-08T12:12:12-05:00","3","We visited the stadium for a stadium tour and museum visit that I'd got as a gift for my partner. 
Pros:
- Buying the tickets online which can be used any day or time is good and we were able to book onto the next tour when we arrived at the stadium so that aspect was great. 
- Stadium was impressive and you can walk all around the outside and get some good views from up on the bridge. 
-Club shop had a good selection (if not a bit pricey!)
- Museum was an interesting addition, there was a lot of exhibits and it was very detailed so we did feel that this was a really good addition to the tour and was something a bit different that not all stadiums have. 
- Staff were friendly 
Cons:
- Although the stadium tour isn't ""guided"" you have a member of staff showing you round and ushering you onto the next section but they don't provide much, if any, information. It's just ""this is the president box/ this is the press room"" ect which seems like a wasted opportunity to be completely honest. Although our ""guide"" was friendly, it just seemed a little pointless them being there. 
- We felt rushed on the stadium tour, there were probably only 3 other couples on our tour but it didn't feel like long enough was given in each section to look at that part of the stadium and take desired photos which was a shame. 

Over all a good stadium and museum that is let down by the stadium tour itself. Has the potential to be a lot better if guides were given a few key facts about each part to make it a bit more interesting and it wasn't so rushed.

A visit to the Estadio do Dragao (the Stadium of the Dragon) home of Portuguese powerhouse FC Porto was somewhat of a cathartic experience for me, helping put several seemingly cursed aspects of my life as a football fan behind me.
 
After repeated failed attempts to see my team play away in Europe, usually in spectacular circumstances, Porto held a somewhat unique place as the only European team I'd ever tried to attend a game of whom the curse also applied - 2018 had seen me arrive in the City on a Saturday night in preparation for a cup game on the Sunday...only for said game to get moved to Saturday afternoon. I still enjoyed my trip to Portugal's second city, and took in their excellent stadium tour and museum, but it remained something of a sticking point with me.
 
Cue my team drawing Porto in the Europa League, it seemed like either the perfect opportunity to end 2 curses at once, or alternatively condemn the city of Porto to a meteor hitting it.
 
Now, admittedly I was working in different circumstances, but I do know from my previous visit that attaining tickets for Porto home games is easily enough done. They sell them online (in what appears to be a fairly user-friendly setup) or you can purchase them from any of the FC Porto stores in the city. Availability obviously depends on the game, for 90% of them you can probably walk in quite easily, but don't expect to rock up on the day of games against Benfica, Sporting, and maybe Boavista (I'm not sure about this one but it is the local derby) and pick up a ticket. Prices are standard for Europe, expect to pay between €25-35 for a ticket.
 
Getting to the Stadium is very simple - a few of Porto's excellent metro lines have a stop literally called 'Estadio do Dragao' and most of these lines also stop at all the main tourist points across the city too. I'll admit I wasn't keeping time but it can't be any longer than 20 minutes from the Trinidade metro hub.
 
Now, being an away fan I was somewhat restricted (rather unnecessarily I feel as the Porto fans didn't appear to really be any trouble at all and were actually quite welcoming) with regards to pre-match experience, but from what I could see there were a few street vendors between the large shopping centre that sits adjacent to the stadium, and a few trucks selling the delightful local Super Bock lager. Sadly we got herded straight in, although again commendations to the local police who actually handled things well and build up a fairly decent rapport with fans as opposed to leading in with batons.
 
When inside the stadium, the catering was, well hard to call. There was quite an extensive menu on the wall, though the vast majority of it wasn't available to us in the away end. Limiting us to hot dogs, crisps and drinks. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate move on Porto's part thinking that's all Scottish fans would want, but I can confirm I am a big fan of a Bifana, and everyone loves Pizza, but this may have been an ordering issue so can't say for certain. The hot dog and drink I got was fairly priced and of good enough quality. In the same concourse there was a small stand selling official FC Porto merchandise.
 
Now, one of the reasons do Dragao had been so high on my list of places I wanted to visit was that it was the first high profile European stadium I can remember being built in my lifetime, at least that I was aware of. This meant that while it still holds a fairly cracking maximum capacity at just over 50,000, it isn't quite the soulless cavern that a lot of older European arenas can prove to be. Indeed, while the away fans are lodged in one of the upper tiers, due to the modern design you still get a very good view of the entire pitch.
 
Likewise the seating is comfortable and spacious (typically for a game I spent on my feet) and in general it's one of the finest venues in terms of design, quality and upkeep I've had the pleasure of taking in a game in. Genuinely excellent modern sporting amphitheatre.
 
If there was but one complaint I had, it was the lack of presence and atmosphere of the Porto fans, however I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt on this one. Kicking off at 6pm local time is a pretty awful idea on UEFA's part, meaning a lot of potential ticket buyers attended late, if at all as working hours in Portugal can run well past this. It's poor planning that ruins the spectacle, and there were still hundreds of Porto fans working their way inside minutes into the game. I suppose I'll just need to attend a game in the home end sometime to really see the Porto fans!
 
With all of this said, I'd still 100% advocate a trip to the Estadio do Dragao, regardless of if you’re a home fan or in the away end. Genuinely one of the best Stadiums I've attended in all of Europe and beyond.

One can almost hear the market woman's catchy cries. Modern days are still filled with those scents and colors, but the Market has gone a step further by adding new delicacies and flavors. The place invites visitors to find out more about its history and about the road taken until the present day. In here all five senses are awakened. And at the end of a working day, this inviting and sensorial space is ideal for a snack among friends, ideal to share thoughts and dreams, or to revive old memories. Life can be smooth, even with abounding sensations. Matches your smile Bom Sucesso Market is a Babel made of costumes, routines and traits of people that are here, and people that arrive. There are shopping bags, and little gifts to be exchanged, there are offices closing new deals and opening new doors. There are local people enjoying the place, but also foreign faces, with different accents and languages, already so familiar. In between the hotel and the market area there is bustle and pauses punctuated with fleeting smiles and loud guffaws. We love this concept that becomes more meaningful when a smile flowers from a pair of lips, when people cross each other's paths in a place where so many things happen.",,,"eu.portugal.northern_portugal.porto","geral@mercadobomsucesso.pt","Europe/Lisbon","1380","600",,,"1380","600",,,"1380","600",,,"1380","600",,,"1380","600",,,"1440","600",,,"1440","600",,,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/25/a5/c7/mercado-bom-sucesso.jpg","false","false","false","false","41.155277","5114203","Porto, Porto District, Northern Portugal","none","-8.628807","Mercado Bom Sucesso","1352",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Open Now","Porto","+351 933 238 609","O encando do Mercado à noite","48","86353351","439","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/05/25/a5/c7/mercado-bom-sucesso.jpg","1024","235","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/25/a5/c7/mercado-bom-sucesso.jpg","550","858","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/25/a5/c7/mercado-bom-sucesso.jpg","2000","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/25/a5/c7/mercado-bom-sucesso.jpg","150","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/25/a5/c7/mercado-bom-sucesso.jpg","50","true","2013-12-16T05:21:09-0500","2013-12-16T05:21:09-0500",,"0","user",,"default","#18 of 375 things to do in Porto","attraction","375","Porto","189180","18","#18 of 375 things to do in Porto","4.5","3.8392677307128906","en","false","2023-04-11T03:55:04-04:00","5","Had a fabulous wine tasting for a group of 20 women  on the 10th of April!

I thought, being mid 50s that I might struggle with this, but not at all, there were also older than me in our group doing it. 
Staff are extremely helpful in harnessing everyone up, then Alex was a superb guide at the top, sharing all of his knowledge about the bridge, its history and of course some top tips for things to do and see around Porto. 
All topped off with a port from a chocolate cup at the top of the climb.","Exciting way to pass an hour.","2023-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg","2","0","0","3","0","2","0","7","2022-08-01T06:28:14-0400","Peter","C","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E0284ECC6874FC0B0484594E2BEAB643","en_IE","0","Peter C","0",,"user","E0284ECC6874FC0B0484594E2BEAB643",,,"Peter C","en","false","2023-04-07T06:38:43-04:00","5","This was by far the best thing we did in Porto.

Porto Bridge Climb is a pretty unique experience and it gives you a panoramic view of Porto and Gaia. We went during the rainy winter season of Porto, so the weather was cloudy and there wasn't much sun. But the view was still pretty terrific (although, I would highly suggest going when the Sun is out). The climb was pretty manageable upwards - as one doesn't feel the steepness of the climb. But coming down, is where one would start to notice how steep the incline is and how tall the bridge actually is. Although it is steep, you won't really have to worry as it is very wide, and there are measures in place to ensure your safety. There will be a guide that brings you up and down the bridge. Our guide - Sergio was very engaging and knowledgeable, telling us stories about the bridge. Overall, it was a fun activity.

The guiding staff seemed really young, like high-school aged. A nice touch to the walk is the chocolate cup of Port wine on the top. The entry is slightly creepy, have to climb some construction stairs and there is a wall with barbed wire on top but then the welcome is really nice. My only complaint is that it's exeggerating to call it a climb. It's just a few stairs, you are up in no time and then you stand in a place where your head almost hitting the bridge, you cannot move around because you still must have the safety rope on you. I'd have totally walked up there without all the safety gears too, it's not scary at all. So that's why the 4 stars, It's kind of sold as a thrill and then it's just not. The view is sort of the same as just crossing one of the pedestrian bridges in Porto. It was fun but not a must-do. If you are on a budget, spare money on skipping this and do something else.","Nice but not a must-have experience","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/14/22/85/d6/patricia-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/22/85/d6/patricia-t.jpg","6","0","0","3","0","8","0","17","2013-05-03T16:10:00-0400","Patrícia","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8A1ECDBF31B150BA6186B93C6247A7D5","en_GB","0","Patrícia T","0",,"user","8A1ECDBF31B150BA6186B93C6247A7D5","189530","Aarhus, Denmark","Patrícia T","en","false","2022-11-14T23:45:06-05:00","5","It is a very exciting experience to see Porto from above, climbing the Arrábida Bridge!

Parque da Cidade, meaning city park, located on the western end of Avenida da Boavista, is one of the city’s lungs. Facing the ocean and with a direct access to Praia Internacional (the beach), the park, has 83 hectares of area and tries to replicate a rural ambience, and that’s why it’s classified as a “naturalist” style park. If you decide to go to the beach, try one of the surf schools based in, and around, Edifício Transparente, and take a look at “She Changes“, a  27-meter high floating sculpture by Janet Echelman","Amazing Park... ending on the beach and sea","2020-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","4","0","19","0","5","22","0","26","2012-08-28T11:44:06-0400","francisco","g","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.9E5E05C0658320BD46A40DFDC8881277","pt","0","francisco g","0",,"user","9E5E05C0658320BD46A40DFDC8881277","189158","Lisbon, Portugal","francisco g","en","false","2019-11-25T23:38:50-05:00","5","Parque da cidade is a beautiful oasis in Porto, great for a walk, bike, yoga or any other sports activity.

It's a haven for bird watchers, children, tired locals looking for a relaxing place, and also for tourists who want to get away from the busy city.

Bring your bike or roller blades, a blanket or some picnic chairs, a couple of sandwiches and a bottle of water and you're all set. You can find private little places to be alone or open areas where you see others sun-bathing. If you're lucky, you might see park rangers patrolling on white horses (i saw them during the weekend).

In my opinion, this is the best park in the city to experience some wild nature. You can walk to it from Casa da Musica/Rotunda da Boavista or, from the Matosinhos coast of the Atlantic Ocean.

On our first full day, we had arranged for a driver/guide, with the Concierge from our hotel in Vila Nova de Gaia, and our first stop was at Parque da Cidade do Porto. We entered just off of Avenida da Boavista, across from the Instituto de Neurociéncias, which was highly coincidental, as one of my wife’s hospitals is a world-renown neurological institute.

The Parque da Cidade do Porto is immense, and lovely, with a broad diversity. We walked along just one path, that took through formal gardens, and large lawns. Our guide indicated that it was the largest “city park” in Portugal, and I believe that easily.

Though we walked but a small portion, we came upon ducks, geese and swans (plus an errant seagull, or two), and saw rabbits and squirrels galore. It was almost like walking through a nature preserve. One observation was that there were very few people in the park, though given its size, maybe they were all just elsewhere?

It was a wonderful way to start a day of exploration.","A Walk in the Park","2018-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","912","0","125","223","34686","1246","0","2381","2005-07-28T00:00:00-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97",,"0",,"0",,"user","F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97","31310","Phoenix, Arizona","The_Loup_Garou","en","false","2019-04-28T12:40:59-04:00","5","The Porto City Park is a large urban park located between Boavista Avenue, Circunvalação Road and the sea.

Also makes you wonder why ´we´dont make things like this any more.

Clearly the organisation behind this ´monstrame´had no need for the pennies of the poor but at every corner there are boxes for ésmolas´(alms) playing on their guilt in promise of relief... just made me sad.

Equally uncomfortable to pay €8/person for entry; we spent about 30 mins and then left. If this is a national monument, not sure what warrants the levy.

I was very uncomfortable in the catacombes and would have liked both more warning about what was down there... and information about those who lie there.","Eerie and Unsettling","2022-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg","9","0","11","3","1","18","0","30","2014-01-08T18:54:21-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2F9B4A70E410EBC5D9685FC1C3F3F5B8","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","2F9B4A70E410EBC5D9685FC1C3F3F5B8","186463","Newport, United Kingdom","jede6aah","en","false","2022-08-05T00:35:42-04:00","5","Set beneath the Bolsa Palace which was partly built on the grounds of St. Francisco convent, this is one of the Porto's best.

The majority of the underground stations are clean, and have an elevator or two, and some have escalators; all have stairs.

Like the CP.pt trains, each Metro car has seats near the doors that are for pregnant women, or handicapped, or seniors.  You may sit in these seats, but if a person of that groups approaches you must surrender the seat to him or her.

Before travelling I looked for the various tickets available for the metro.  The Andante Tour Card was recommended which can be used on the metro, buses and some regional trains with unlimited use.  We headed for the metro which is a 2 minute walk from the airport and tried to use the ticket machine.  A very helpful man told us we could only buy the Tour card in the information centre within the airport, so back we went.   We  informed them we were in Porto for 3 days and were offered the 3 day card for 15 euros each.   What we didnt realise was we were able to walk all the main attractions within the city so only used the card from and to the airport!!  Waste of 30 euros in total. One way to the airport is only 2.60 euros.
However, I should say Porto is very hilly so if you arent able bodied you may need to use the metro more frequently but I would suggest buying a single ticket from the airport and then find your bearings.  Our Air BnB was quite central.

Top tip: at the airport when you buy your ticket for the first time, ask one of the staff to show you how to use the ticket machine - and video the process with your phone for future reference! Also, buy 5 trips or more at a time on the card that the machine will give you, so you don’t have to join the queues of tourists trying to figure out how to buy their tickets. To go to the coast I recommend one of the hop on hop off buses, there are yellow, red and blue companies in competition with each other.","Porto Metro","2022-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg","6","0","27","21","1","19","0","46","2009-11-08T12:36:35-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.57F55A10207845E74E0E46BA3D5A118B","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","57F55A10207845E74E0E46BA3D5A118B",,"london","letouquetlover","59","Transportation",,,,,"#15 of 375 things to do in Porto","168","Mass Transportation Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189180-d9705615-Reviews-Metro_do_Porto-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html","https://www.metrodoporto.pt","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189180-d9705615-Metro_do_Porto-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html"

The project took shape in 1999 after the Rem Koolhaas & Ellen van Loon - Office for Metropolitan Architecture won the international architectural competition. Work began in 1999 on the site of Porto's former central tram garage on the Rotunda da Boavista, and Casa da Musica opened its doors to the public on April 15th , 2005. Casa da Musica was planned as a home for all types of music and it is not only part of the urban redevelopment of Porto but also part of a network of cultural facilities, for the city of Porto and for the wider world. Underlying it is an innovative and wide-ranging cultural project, which aims to make an exciting contribution to the national and international music scene, as an arena for all types of musical events - from classical music to jazz, from fado to electronic music, from great international productions to more experimental projects. Besides concerts, recitals and other types of performance, Casa da Musica also organises events for musicians and musicologists and invests in research into the origins of Portuguese music. In addition, it plays a very important role in music education. It is a cultural meeting point between music and other areas of artistic creation and knowledge, providing a space for all kinds of audiences and creators.",,,"eu.portugal.northern_portugal.porto","info@casadamusica.com","Europe/Lisbon","1080","600",,,"1140","600",,,"1140","600",,,"1140","600",,,"1140","600",,,"1140","600",,,"1140","600",,,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/bd/f8/cb/casa-da-musica.jpg","false","false","false","false","41.15841","569828","Porto, Porto District, Northern Portugal","none","-8.63079","Casa da Musica","2313","true","true","$5.00",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/6e/f2/45.jpg","","Viator","$28.84","Hop-on Hop-off Tours","5391P26","$29","Porto Premium 3 in 1: Hop-On Hop-Off Bus, Tram Tour and Guindais Funicular","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FPorto-Premium-3-in-1%2Fd26879-5391P26%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=61ebd70d6f2d62dc8&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=569828&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/07/1e/c2/7e.jpg","","Viator","$24.40","Hop-on Hop-off Tours","5391P57","$25","Porto Vintage Hop on Hop off","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FPorto-Vintage-Hop-on-Hop-off%2Fd26879-5391P57%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=6385d2c9d2c568ac9&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=2&cnt=1&geo=569828&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/8d/5c/6f.jpg","","Viator","$94.28","Historical & Heritage Tours","17462P4","$95","Porto city day tour with wine tasting and river cruise","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FPorto-Full-Day-Tour-Including-River-Cruise-WineTasting-and-Lunch%2Fd26879-17462P4%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=b9020860324d5de0d&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=3&cnt=1&geo=569828&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/09/98/16/a7.jpg","","Viator","$83.19","Cultural Tours","7592P14","$84","Porto: Small Group City Tour Full Day with Lunch, Wine Tasting & Cruise","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FPorto-City-Tour-Full-Day-with-Lunch-and-Wine-Tasting%2Fd26879-7592P14%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=b9941613c2aa16cc2&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=4&cnt=1&geo=569828&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0b/79/e0/ae.jpg","","Viator","$165.56","Private Sightseeing Tours","8448P2","$166","Private Tour: Porto City and Wine Tasting","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FPorto-City-and-Wine-Tasting-Private-Tour%2Fd26879-8448P2%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=304aca251ee360aaa&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=5&cnt=1&geo=569828&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true","Closed Now","Porto","+351 22 012 0220","Casa da Musica","3","113113291","577","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/06/bd/f8/cb/casa-da-musica.jpg","1024","310","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/bd/f8/cb/casa-da-musica.jpg","550","1127","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/bd/f8/cb/casa-da-musica.jpg","2000","141","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/bd/f8/cb/casa-da-musica.jpg","250","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/bd/f8/cb/casa-da-musica.jpg","50","false","2014-10-16T07:27:26-0400","2014-10-16T07:27:26-0400",,"0","user",,"default","#28 of 375 things to do in Porto","attraction","375","Porto","189180","28","#28 of 375 things to do in Porto","4.0","3.7672858238220215","en","false","2023-04-07T09:50:49-04:00","4","Loved the classical music performance we went to (Mozart and Wagner).

The Third Religious Order of Our lady of Carmo in Oporto was founded in 1736 and opened for worship on July 24 ,1768. Masses everyday by 9:30 a.m., 3 p.m. and Sunday another mass by 12:30.

One may visit the Touristic circuit by a small fee that helps to rebuild and restore its heritage: by 3,5 euros one may visit the Hidden House (narrowest house of Oporto), church, catacombs, sacristy and three other rooms with ancient paintings and vestments, available everytime there isn't an event. To visit only the hidden house, there's a ticket which costs 2 euros. Whenever wishing just to only see the church (with no entry fee), we ask you to be a bit earlier than the time of mass, so not to interrupt the masses.",,,"eu.portugal.northern_portugal.porto","circuitoigreja@ordemdocarmo.pt","Europe/Lisbon","1080","570",,,"1080","570",,,"1080","570",,,"1080","570",,,"1080","570",,,"1080","570",,,"1080","570",,,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/a2/f2/3c/20170213-112630-largejpg.jpg","false","false","false","false","41.147346","2394636","Porto, Porto District, Northern Portugal","none","-8.616221","Igreja do Carmo","1109","true","true","$1.11",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/6e/f2/45.jpg","","Viator","$28.84","Hop-on Hop-off Tours","5391P26","$29","Porto Premium 3 in 1: Hop-On Hop-Off Bus, Tram Tour and Guindais Funicular","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FPorto-Premium-3-in-1%2Fd26879-5391P26%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=61ebd70d6f2d62dc8&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=2394636&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/07/1e/c2/80.jpg","","Viator","$26.62","Hop-on Hop-off Tours","5391PORTOHOHO","$27","Porto Hop-On Hop-Off Tour with Optional River Cruise and Wine Tasting","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FPorto-Hop-On-Hop-Off-Tour-with-Optional-River-Cruise-and-Wine-Tasting%2Fd26879-5391PORTOHOHO%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=9663db6b8a856fb81&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=2&cnt=1&geo=2394636&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0a/7e/16/1c.jpg","","Viator","$27.73","Walking Tours","17498P1","$28"," Lisbon Essential Walking Tour: History, Stories and Lifestyle","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FLisbon%2FLisbon-Essential-Tour-History-Stories-Lifestyle%2Fd538-17498P1%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=df25f1464b86e1643&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=3&cnt=1&geo=2394636&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/75/41/69.jpg","","Viator","$21.08","Historical & Heritage Tours","7372P7","$22","Essential Porto Walking Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FEssential-Porto-Walking-Tour-with-Wine-Tasting%2Fd26879-7372P7%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=5a2a4997d778f0dbe&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=4&cnt=1&geo=2394636&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0a/c8/c8/e0.jpg","","Viator","$38.82","Tuk Tuk Tours","86748P1","$39","Guided Tour to the Historical Center on a Tuk Tuk","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPorto%2FSee-city-sights-from-a-Tuk-Tuk%2Fd26879-86748P1%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=4126c7c9802d786e3&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=5&cnt=1&geo=2394636&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true","Closed Now","Porto","+351 22 207 8400","","2","245559868","576","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0e/a2/f2/3c/20170213-112630-largejpg.jpg","1024","309","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/a2/f2/3c/20170213-112630-largejpg.jpg","550","2322","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/a2/f2/3c/20170213-112630-largejpg.jpg","4128","141","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0e/a2/f2/3c/20170213-112630-largejpg.jpg","250","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/a2/f2/3c/20170213-112630-largejpg.jpg","50","false","2017-03-11T11:20:26-0500","2017-03-11T11:20:26-0500",,"0","user",,"default","#17 of 375 things to do in Porto","attraction","375","Porto","189180","17","#17 of 375 things to do in Porto","4.5","3.8523900508880615","en","false","2023-04-06T11:37:04-04:00","4","This twin Baroque style church is most recognizable place with its tiled side facade in Porto as well as Clerigos and Se do Porto.

To separate the two churches, a short space was left between them in which a house was built whose existence is not recognizable from the outside being only 1.5 m wide and for this reason called Casa Escondida do Porto. If the facade of the church, on which Santa Anna stands out, to whom the order was very devoted, is relatively similar to the other churches, what makes Igreja do Carmo readily recognizable is the large panel of azulejos, depicting scenes from the foundation of the Carmelite Order. By paying a really cheap entrance ticket, you can visit the church and then continue with a visit to the tourist circuit of the Order of Carmo. The circuit begins with a stop to a small catacomb and continues in a few rooms where you can admire several objects belonging to the order such as relics, books, ancient hospital instruments, paintings, sculptures and several other objects, leaving the chuch from a side door next to the azulejo at the end of the tour. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Porto for a few days.","Interesting visit of the church and the circuit of the Order of Carmo","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","196","0","0","16","96","10","0","222","2016-12-04T11:31:32-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","2E6EAE2D0AF392B3E9A8332949DB35E6","187824","La Spezia, Italy","bluebay06","en","false","2022-12-16T09:57:01-05:00","5","We passed by the two churches (Carmo and Carmelitas) on a walking tour.

Its entrance was through the Igreja do Carmo but, although it was mid-afternoon, the entracce was closed. The house was built because the churches were originally a monastery and a convent, and the monks and nuns were not allowed to share a wall!

There are two churches, Igreja do Carmo and Igreja dos Carmelitas only separated by a very narrow house. Igreja do Carmo is the more striking of the two with its baroque/Rococo façade and religious sculptures while Igreja dos Carmelitas looks simpler with its more classical façade. Igreja do Carmo is also famous for the tiles on the side facade depicting scenes alluding to the founding of the Carmelite order and Mount Carmel. History says that it was not allowed at that time for two churches to share the same wall. Therefore, one of the narrowest houses in Portugal, Casa Escondia do Porto, was built between the churches, only 1.5 meters wide. However, it is more likely that the house was created for more technical and aesthetic reasons.","The twin churches","2022-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg","150","0","0","26","0","1","0","177","2016-12-31T03:52:41-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6D82824ED114D174F1833D77D3AE8E93","sv","0",,"0",,"user","6D82824ED114D174F1833D77D3AE8E93","189894","Gothenburg, Sweden","dennys667","47","Sights & Landmarks",,,,,"#17 of 375 things to do in Porto","175","Churches & Cathedrals",,,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189180-d2394636-Reviews-Igreja_do_Carmo-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html","http://www.facebook.com/tourCarmoPorto/","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189180-d2394636-Igreja_do_Carmo-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html"

The first section is all interactive and teaches you about life on a ship and various famous Portuguese explorers. I knew nothing about Portuguese history so this was a good experience and explained how a lot of Portuguese products and culture had come about. The place was pretty empty with a few kids who were really enjoying it and one family said this was their second trip in two days. The second part is a riverboat type ride with different sections about Portuguese travels around the world. It was mostly aimed at children but I actually had a great time - although wasn't overly happy about the stuffed animals. Again very informative and once you depart you enter a very well stocked gift shop. I thought that this whole experience was really modern and there isn't really anything else like it that I saw in Porto. The price is fairly is fairly steep at around €24 for an adult ticket but the amount of investment that has gone into the attraction makes this price understandable.

We spent about 10 minutes looking through the initial rooms where the majority of exhibits were extensive written paragraphs- useless if you're 4 or 2 and can't read! The kids briefly admired the lifesize plastic rhino (honestly very little else for small kids, I'm genuinely confused as to how they settled on €14 being the right entry price for this) then suddenly we found ourselves at the VERY long, very narrow queue for the boat ride which we couldn't fit the buggy into. Cue 4 year old sobbing hysterically because of the creepy moving mannequins stationed in this room and baby crying because she was fed up of the queueing in the dark.

But, fortunately, those times passed and now we have only silent architectural artefacts remind us of those embarrassing forms of fanaticism...
The faith now lives mainly inside us and the very premises like that we visit to stay close to ourselves.
I definitely like this place since early in the morning apart the very opening it is always free from any visitors, some beautiful organ  music is played at some background and there are no any anti-social elements over the porch...

This is one of the best kept secrets of the city of Porto, as it is still not in the rank of the most tourist-flooded places.
I ​discovered ​it ​by myself​,​ when watching episode 16, on September 1, 2021, of the TV series Visita Guiada, on RTP (Portuguese television).
Since than, I was ​just ​waiting for my next trip to the city of Porto, to see it.
It did not disappoint my expectations, as this is one of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen, in several countries in the world that I ​already ​visited.
Its construction began in 1416 and it was completed in 1457.
But a year ago​​ it reopened, after an exhaustive restoration which took about 3 years​,​ that returned it all its former splendor.
An explanatory film is shown in an exhibition room inside.
Entrance is through a ​discrete ​door at the end of Largo Primeiro de Novembro, to the left of the GNR quarters.
This church is a reference of the Portuguese Baroque and one of the greatest examples of gilded woodwork in Portugal.
Its beauty is breathtaking and it is a must see in the city of Porto.
Offers of eggs are regularly left next to the main altar, by couples who believe that Santa Clara will do a miracle, preventing it from raining during their wedding ceremony.
To prevent her from forgetting, they put also their names, along with the​ir​ offer.","Eggs for Santa Clara","2022-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/15/17/3d/44/carlos-angra.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/17/3d/44/carlos-angra.jpg","11","0","0","11","7","6","0","28","2009-06-14T12:18:18-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.931DCD4AC05A45DDBBA331BC0D1E0371","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","931DCD4AC05A45DDBBA331BC0D1E0371","189137","Angra do Heroismo, Portugal","CARLOS_ANGRA","en","false","2022-11-19T02:11:25-05:00","5","well worth the time to visit a true master piece of carving its not a big visit but worth  a couple of hours","special","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/21/d3/ec/9d/bas-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/21/d3/ec/9d/bas-t.jpg","343","0","2","64","642","186","0","593","2015-05-19T07:21:41-0400","bas","t","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.88EBB70F06D74D8141A3A8971106A2BC","en_UK","0","bas t","0",,"user","88EBB70F06D74D8141A3A8971106A2BC","188644","Brussels, Belgium","bas t","en","false","2022-10-20T11:13:40-04:00","1","Today,

Here in addition to photographing the lighthouse you can also see the mouth of the river Duero in the Atlantic Ocean. Also from here you can start the long walk along the coast that will take you beyond the national park of Porto. Essential to disconnect a little from the daily visits that the city offers and to breathe the air of ""sea"".

I found it hard to drag myself away. We arrived just before 11am and the tide was already going out, so it must have been even more spectacular earlier. Although Porto isn’t a big city, there was something refreshing about getting away from the narrow streets and seeing the space of the horizon. We are glad that we spent some time here.

We’d recommend Tram #1, which takes less than half and hour to get to the last stop and it’s then an easy (and flat!) 10-minute walk to the lighthouses. Rather than returning by tram, walk back along the Douro, which takes under an hour. Look out for the supermarket on the way, if you need provisions.","Wild and wonderful","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1c/2f/6b/78/queencherryuk.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/2f/6b/78/queencherryuk.jpg","26","0","0","14","4","21","0","61","2016-05-18T03:40:38-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.33B4130CE2E882C8B8E1AEAF32C7380B","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","33B4130CE2E882C8B8E1AEAF32C7380B","656895","Sawbridgeworth, United Kingdom","QueenCherryUK","en","false","2019-10-06T21:45:51-04:00","4","The coast at the mouth of the Duoro is pleasant but not as spectacular as the City if you are touring - its flat though!!","I'd spend my time in the City","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","415","0","0","49","0","65","0","529","2008-08-26T18:39:47-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FA6ADBB961BAF2597DBCFBC631974F75","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","FA6ADBB961BAF2597DBCFBC631974F75","503790","Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom","490theos","en","false","2019-09-25T13:12:11-04:00","4","The area surrounding this site is great for a look.

So, good to start exploring the city from there and slowly moving to the historical centre.","Very lively place with option to taste wine and food","2022-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/a3/1a/c8/desito07.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/a3/1a/c8/desito07.jpg","343","0","30","33","672","161","0","537","2009-06-15T18:21:38-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D4554178B28BD5BA6836A0338DE8F6C7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","D4554178B28BD5BA6836A0338DE8F6C7","186298","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","desito07","en","false","2022-10-17T09:17:07-04:00","4","Newly renovated, fresh market.

To make things worse we were not shown the ticket price list at the ticket office so missed out on the discount for the over 66yrs.

This is not a place to go if you're looking for a permanent exhibit of Picassos, Cezzanes, and Matisses. Instead I saw a beautifully done exhibition of the architecture of Alvaro Siza, Portugal's Frank Lloyd Wright. He designed this museum. It contained amazing wood models of many of his projects, some completed, others never built. If you appreciate modern architecture,this is a must-see.

Then, I went to the other main exhibit hall to see the collage-ish work of Pedro Cabrita Reis -- Cabita. Cool stuff.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to walk the park.

The main museum was interesting but not mindblowing, but walking around the grounds to the home and farm were really the highlights. It was really enjoyable to explore the grounds - there's lots of art and nature to enjoy - and it was a nice break from city streets.  We even got to enjoy some time hanging with a cow who took an interest in us. The home was sporting an installation of significant works from different decades that the Museu had previously featured. They were spread throughout the home in rather anachronistic ways, but did not detract from the house itself. I can see why the poor reviews of this site are from rainy days - this is not a large  collection housed in a massive indoor space - to fully enjoy what the Serralves has to offer, one needs to be happy walking the property as well. Rain would diminish this trip considerably.","On a gorgeous day, this sanctuary is a treat.","2019-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","4","0","0","2","0","1","0","7","2011-05-11T07:01:39-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E66FF5BECB1EB8B6503749FB27954AC8","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","E66FF5BECB1EB8B6503749FB27954AC8",,,"SybilO5","49","Museums","57","Nature & Parks","60","Traveler Resources","#38 of 375 things to do in Porto","21","Libraries","70","Parks","28","Art Museums",,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189180-d243628-Reviews-Museu_Serralves-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html","http://www.serralves.pt/en/","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189180-d243628-Museu_Serralves-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html"

Outside there is plenty of open space and there is a large square, shared, I would think, with the Cathedral. The views from here are literally breathtaking.

We utilised both so I will comment on both.
The bar / restaurant is reached from a tree lined path from the road above. It has an internal restaurant section but the best spots are the tables under umbrellas fronting the beach. We cannot comment on the food as we only used it as a bar for coffees mid morning and then something stronger in the afternoon. The service levels did tend to suffer when it got busy but as long as you have a table fronting the sea with its superb views of the setting sun, then you can put up with this.
As for the beach it’s a nice stretch of sand but like all the beaches here is quite rocky and faces out to the Atlantic, which tends to be quite wavy, even on a fairly flat day, so it’s not ideal for swimming. There are no beach facilities so bring your own towels to sit on and umbrellas for shade, as you have to get here quite early to beat the locals who tend to sit by the few rocks that do afford shade.","Beach with a bar restaurant of the same name.","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/bf/2e/6b/steve-of-n21.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/bf/2e/6b/steve-of-n21.jpg","1049","0","452","182","42","724","0","1956","2011-01-08T12:05:32-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F1583C3624BFBE4A4C296A408CE83AB1","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","F1583C3624BFBE4A4C296A408CE83AB1","186338","London, United Kingdom","Steve_of_N21","en","false","2022-05-02T06:37:58-04:00","5","Had lunch with a friend visiting us fro UK.

The atmosphere was very relaxing and the design just really on point. The pots, the cutlery, everything was of our taste. In two we had the couvert (bread, two types of butter, cream cheese and tomato dip), an appetizer with foie gras on brioche and fig (delicious combination of flavours) and an octopus bean stew. Let me tell you, the taste of each of these dishes was mindblowing. The different ingredients were balanced well and the resulting flavour was really good. For two people the 1-2 persons portion of the octopus was enough, so I would suggest to have an appetizer like the foie gras (again, amazing!) and then a main course. The only comment about the octopus (which was really soft, delicate and great with the beans) is that I would have probably left the chorizo out. We accompained everything with a glass of sangria (we tried both versions, white and red) and it was very refreshing. For finish, we had a Natas do Universo (lemony super fresh mousse) and a Banana e Caramelo V 2.0 (a more rich caramel dessert) and two coffees. Probably we could have skipped the desserts given the price and amount/richness. The service was very good and the bill was for sure pricey (90.40 €) but overall proportionate with the quality of the food, the details at the table and the whole experience here. We got out full and happy. Really amazed by this place.

After viewing the city hall, you can walk down the Avenue which has several statues worth seeing and numerous cafés and restaurants for refreshments.","Sits At The Head Of A Long Avenue","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/ef/32/a7/martyncymro.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/ef/32/a7/martyncymro.jpg","998","0","15","49","272","134","0","1181","2010-03-01T19:02:10-0500","Martyn","W","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E7DF28EE6FD435951222C9DF77A35BE6","en_US","0","Martyn W","0",,"user","E7DF28EE6FD435951222C9DF77A35BE6","189143","Coimbra, Portugal","Martyn W","en","false","2019-11-02T19:22:19-04:00","5","Fun stop to get your pic on the Porto sign.

Visit to the museum is free😀.","Prison to Museum","2020-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","12","0","0","4","0","22","0","38","2019-08-19T10:41:25-0400","Dick","C","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.DCBEF6C1D38D55BB50C4F9E7381D4EEA","en_US","0","Dick C","0",,"user","DCBEF6C1D38D55BB50C4F9E7381D4EEA","294265","Singapore, Singapore","Dick C","en","false","2019-10-29T13:59:19-04:00","1","As others have noted, a largely empty former prison.

As a former officer having worked in several old victorian jails, I was really interested to view the interior.  I guess if the walls could tell a story.

I speak reasonable French and a little Spanish but neither help enough with Portuguese!

There were only about 10 other visitors in the building when I was there and I loved the way the building's original purpose remains so obvious.  I found standing in the women's cell an oddly moving experience.

I wanted more information/photographs about the prison AND more about photography.  It felt like all the effort/resources had gone into preserving the building and there wasn't enough left for the contents!  

I liked the (very) small but thought-provoking exhibition of work by two photographers - Edson Chaga's pictures stopped me in my tracks and the eloquence of Lien Botha's Wonderboom made me cry.  

Someone at the museum clearly has good ideas/connections but there is a great opportunity here to do MUCH better.

This park derives its name from its centerpiece fountain, depicting winged lions, which hold up the large bowl of the fountain.

Our guide suggested that this project was commissioned by the Municipal Water Authority of Oporto, and that makes sense, given the flowing waters from both above the lions, and from their mouths. Initially, it was to commemorate the water system of the city.

The Parça dos Leões is located inside of a larger park, Praça de Gomes Teixeira, with beautiful gardens.

We spent time studying the lions, and the overall design of the fountain, itself. Besides being lovely, and a work of art, the sound of the falling water had a soothing effect in this urban environment.

We felt that our stop at the Parça dos Leões was well worth our time. I would suggest budgeting about 30 mins for the park, unless one might want to linger, say over a picnic, and there are also many restaurants in the immediate area.","A Lovely & Symbolic Fountain","2018-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","912","0","125","223","34686","1246","0","2381","2005-07-28T00:00:00-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97",,"0",,"0",,"user","F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97","31310","Phoenix, Arizona","The_Loup_Garou","en","false","2019-04-22T12:30:10-04:00","4","As you walk around the city, one to enjoy.

This place is breathtaking, rows of mausoleums finished to the highest standards with sculptures by some famous artists.   Some had glass fronted doors showing the lavish interiors and ornate decorations.

The front part of the cemetery and chapel could be accessed by wheelchair users as the paths are very flat and wide but some place would be a bit difficult so bear that in mind if you are somebody in your party is a wheelchair user. 

It's rather strange to say a 'must see' on a cemetery but this place shouldn't be missed.  It was a very miserable day when I visited, grey sky and raining so photography was very difficult which is shame as this would be perfect for getting some excellent shots.","Absolutely fascinating","2019-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","52","0","0","8","0","70","0","130","2019-06-22T04:38:29-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D3E517288D513AA9A55F9D37902655EF","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","D3E517288D513AA9A55F9D37902655EF","293997","Manama, Bahrain","I3493BMbrianp","en","false","2019-06-25T14:11:46-04:00","4","Spent two hours just walking around admiring this very different celebration of death and family.

Such is the case with the Agramonte Cemetery, located in Porto, which proved to be an interesting venue to spend a couple of hours. It also houses one of Portugal’s most important collections of sculptures, including works by Soares dos Reis and Teixeira Lopes.

Agramonte was created in a hurry in 1855, as an appropriate burial site was urgently needed for the victims of a sizeable cholera epidemic. Subsequently, in 1869, the cemetery was restructured and incorporated ‘private’ cemeteries that were run by various Brotherhoods within the city. These fenced areas still exist, enclosing the sections operated by the Orders of Carmo, Trindade and Sao Francisco. These three sections take up a sizeable part of the 12 hectare cemetery.

The Order of Carmo has the largest of the three Brotherhood sections, but it is also the least well-maintained. Whereas most of the cemetery has neatly maintained stone footpaths, the Carmo section has dirt pathways with weeds growing along the edges. Both of the sections run by the Orders of Trindade and Sao Francisco have decorative entrance gates and have neat, tidy footpaths.

Between 1870 and 1874, shortly after the restructuring of the cemetery, the chapel was constructed. It was designed by engineer Gustavo Adolfo Goncalves e Sousa. The chapel was enlarged in 1906 by architect Jose Marques da Silva.  Then, in 1925, the Italian painter Silvestro Silvestri produced the Byzantine-inspired paintings within the chapel.

Another sizeable building within the cemetery is the oval-shaped Municipal Burial Monument. This granite and iron construction has three levels (one being below ground). As each of the repositories is small in size, I am assuming that the building is an ossuary, and that each space contains only the bones of the deceased, re-located some time after an in-ground burial.

A memorial monument in the centre of the cemetery highlights a tragic historical event that occurred on 20th March, 1888. On that night, the Baquet Theatre was completely destroyed by a fire that killed 120 people. The monument to the victims includes pieces from the destroyed theatre.

Whilst the cemetery has areas for the more common in-ground graves, much of the facility is taken up by above-ground buildings – crypts or mausoleums – that house coffins of family members. These structures come in a variety of styles and sizes. Some are sombre granite with columns, whilst others mirror a more local style of building, with red slate roofs and even azulejo tiles. Many feature glass doors (some with with lace curtains) and some have their own stained-glass windows on the rear wall. Each one is built in a style preferred by the respective families, whose loved ones are housed within. It is evident that family members visit many of these vaults on a regular basis, as fresh flowers were placed inside many of them.

Whilst most of the crypts bear family names, the casual observer has no insight into the history of those who lay within. However, for some of the more notable individuals, the cemetery has erected plaques that provide a little historical context. These plaques reveal that those interred within the cemetery include actors, musicians, artists, bankers, wine merchants, mayors, race car drivers, etc. 

In contrast to the large family mausoleums, many of the people interred in the cemetery have a simple and small space, in one of the ossuaries that can be found along the perimeter of the property. Many of these small burial spaces have fresh flowers attached to them, presumably placed there by family members and loved ones. Due to the height of these ossuaries, the cemetery provides step ladders so that the individual spaces can be reached.

An interesting place to visit. To see the majority of the cemetery, you'll need about two hours.","Interesting, historic cemetery","2018-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/60/39/52/morfish.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/60/39/52/morfish.jpg","385","0","131","122","2145","187","0","694","2009-12-28T19:32:10-0500","Craig","M","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.5A8A1CA3BD94D4108BEA5CA83DD96F66","en_US","0","Craig M","0",,"user","5A8A1CA3BD94D4108BEA5CA83DD96F66","189180","Porto, Portugal","Craig M","en","false","2018-05-01T21:08:07-04:00","5","The cemetery is one of the most beautiful cemeteries I have ever been; I normally don’t fancy cemeteries, but that one got me.

The front of the church shows off its highly interesting and beautiful baroque architecture. The interior has a stunning single nave in granite and marble and covered in baroque carvings.
In the main chapel, attention is drawn to the polychromatic altarpiece
The tower extends upwards through 75 meters of elegance forming rhythmic stages before rising to its crowning glory, the spherical clock house.
But be careful, you have to climb 225 steps, you have to be fit, the queue at the entrance is only for the tower, anyway I recommend going up because the views are extraordinary","Without a doubt the most beautiful church in Porto","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1c/2d/d8/60/francisco-jose-f.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/2d/d8/60/francisco-jose-f.jpg","154","0","0","31","0","139","0","324","2019-07-15T04:50:39-0400","FRANCISCO JOSE","F","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.847C00F5CC05602466D721446A19B5CB","en_UK","0","FRANCISCO JOSE F","0",,"user","847C00F5CC05602466D721446A19B5CB","644339","Las Rozas, Spain","FRANCISCO JOSE F","en","false","2022-04-14T08:50:49-04:00","4","Now, this church has  The Tower  dos Clérigos as part of it.

I would have paid a lot more to walk this historic museum and read and view its huge amount of information. A docent would have been nice, but they work on a shoestring budget. I see that trip advisor offers a personal tour of this museum which might be nice if you want more information.
So, some highlights: The mosaic floors from the actual castle; good use of digital displays to focus on porcelain brought back from Asia; good use of interactive displays of indigenous flora and fauna brought back from Brazil complete with animal sounds. The diorama of the city that uses a red laser light to point out areas of Porto from Henry the Navigator’s days was very informative. It helped my understanding of the various areas of Porto snd how they developed. we had seen what turned out be parts of the original city wall in Batahla near the Funicular. I could go on and on, but I believe you must see this yourself, since each person has different interests. Unfortunately, the entry to this fine museum is currently hidden behind  scaffolding and red and orange netting.

One of the rules of the Misercordia was that portraits had to be made of each benefactor, which were displayed briefly each year. Consequently, there are a lot of portraits of benefactors in this museum. We had a good look at everything, and spent about an hour altogether, but all agreed at the end we'd been a bit disappointed in the specialised subject matter. There was a surprising display of Olivetti typewriters in the room which had been built for displaying the portraits of benefactors, which took me back to my days learning to touch-type on a Lettera 32 in 1969, a skill which has stood me in good stead over the years.

The trams are a treat to look at but also it is very interesting to learn how such an enterprise was sustained by early versions of electricity plants and before then, horses and steam. The whole building is also great to look at, looking like a scene out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis with its early electric plant and monstrously big machinery  - well worth the visit for that architectural aspect & industrial heritage alone.

If you are interested at least to some extent in the Porto trams, trams/railways in general or the history of Porto, it is worth visiting. Beware that it is not as encompassing as some railway museums in UK or Japan, nor is it too family friendly as those in US. 
Recently remodelled, the exhibition halls were well organised. We found every explanation and instruction in English too, and could easily understand the history of Porto tram system and its rolling stock.
The souvenir shops had some nicely designed items.
If you plan to ride a tram from Carmo to the museum, do not fail to wave to show your intent to ride to the driver. While some people may think Carmo is the origin of the Line 18, it seems to be considered as just one of the stops en route (of a circular route) where trams just pass through unless either you wave or a passenger already on it requests for a stop. 

ポルトの市内電車の歴史に特化した博物館です。総合的な日本の鉄道関連の博物館に比べると見劣りするかもしれませんが、予めそういう場所だと納得したうえであれば十分に入館する価値があります。車両展示はありますが、車内に入ったり触ったりといった子供向けのアトラクションは期待しないほうがいいです。
ポルトガルの同種の博物館に比べ英語の説明が充実しており（ポルトガル語の説明と比べると、直訳ではなく、少し雑な内容になっている場合もありますが）、展示の流れもわかりやすいので、ポルトと市内電車の歴史がすんなり頭に入ってきます。
土産品コーナーには街角の土産物店よりはかなり洗練された市電関連のデザイングッズが売られていました。
なお、市街地Carmoから18番のトラムに乗る場合、必ず手をあげて運転士に意思表示してください。ここは起点ではなく循環系統の途中停留所扱いのようで、車内の乗客が降車の合図をするか、待っている人が乗る旨を知らせない限り通過します。そして、往々にして中の乗客は博物館から通しで乗っている（また元の方向に戻る）観光客ばかりだったりします。","Worth if you are interested at least to some extent in ...","2018-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","19","0","0","15","0","15","0","49","2017-01-13T02:02:26-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E116FEBA5F3912BD558777207FA5D472","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","E116FEBA5F3912BD558777207FA5D472","41003","Bethesda, Maryland","jollybegood","en","false","2018-11-23T05:38:49-05:00","2","Decided to visit the tram museum on my last morning in Porto as it was right next door to my hotel.

In the first section there are some well preserved tram carriages, with information boards that explain their individual histories. The second section upstairs is a collection of engines and electric generators of varying ages, which I did not find very interesting. And that’s it!

There are quite a few companies that offer a very good boat ride of about 45 minutes in which you can enjoy the view of the six bridges that cross the Douro River.
Any time is good to do it, there are many departures and numbers of boats and companies, you do not have to book in advance
Perhaps the best time is at sunset, when the rays of light illuminate them with special colors

Its shape and colours greatly contributed to its popular name  ""Anémona"" (sea anemone) as the sculpture relates to its coastal and maritime location.","an impressive visual suspended over a large roundabout","2019-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/0f/b2/f6/juliusvtravel.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/0f/b2/f6/juliusvtravel.jpg","117","0","0","26","3211","108","0","251","2014-12-17T05:09:12-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.CB5CE13CA9754979A4A24789AD870DE1","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","CB5CE13CA9754979A4A24789AD870DE1","-1","Naples, Campania, Italy","JuliusVtravel","47","Sights & Landmarks",,,,,"#36 of 375 things to do in Porto","163","Points of Interest & Landmarks",,,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189180-d10547718-Reviews-She_Changes_The_Anemone-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html","http://www.echelman.com/project/she-changes/","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189180-d10547718-She_Changes_The_Anemone-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html"

We travel all over the world to visit Palaces, Historic Houses, Castles and unique Museums with worthy collections.
On our recent trip to Oporto we had on our must see list the fascinating CASA MUSEU de CASTRO which was left to the state by the owners family for everyone to enjoy. It was given to the Museu Nacional de Soares dos Reis to preserve, present and allow visits.
This House Museum is a 30 minute walk from the centre of Oporto so is easily accessible by foot or 15 minute metro station.
However even though the internet website stated it was open daily, on arrival we found it was never open to the general public without pre-booking and arranging a time and date direct with the SOARES dos REIS MUSEUM. Thus making a visit here almost impossible to experience without jumping over numerous fences.
(If you use the internet to look at the images of this house museum you will all see why it is so special).
This is totally unacceptable and we urge, request and plead for the owning museum to consider allowing this house museum, which has a series of the most unique interiors and furnishings in Portugal, to be open at least 1 or 2 days a week during the season for all to experience, even if it is by guided tour only in small groups of 6 people at a time.
.......In the meantime whilst the management and curatorial team at the Soares dos Reis consider this review, may I suggest to all like minded art lovers that they enjoy the limited collection of the owning museum here, and then continue to what we thought was the best collection of art, furniture, porcelain, sculpture and family treasures in Oporto at the wonderful TEIXEIRA LOPES HOUSE MUSEUM in the Gaia district just over the bridge. It is by guided tour of upto 1 and1/2 hours but is unforgettable in its period decor and was our Oporto highlight.","Owner of the CASA MUSEU FERNANDO de CASTRO.","2019-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","32","0","11","3","0","3","0","38","2014-06-26T10:31:52-0400","stephen","w","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B48D553AB68E07258E4D13BBBC568921","en_UK","0","stephen w","0",,"user","B48D553AB68E07258E4D13BBBC568921","504162","Bagshot, United Kingdom","stephen w","en","false","2019-07-28T16:10:23-04:00","4","Located in the Carrancas Palace, the museum, named after a Portuense benefactor and sculptor, houses a great collection of 19th and 20th century Portuguese paintings, sculpture, furniture and ceramics.

All Portuguese art, mostly from those who have long passed on, so expect dour, melancholic and morose expressions - typically Iberian art. But there are gems, particularly some of the later 1900s work, exquisite sculptures, stunning jewellery, and for me as an expat Aussie, even a painting of home.

However, the restaurant was closed and we ended up in a cafe next door with a tourist menu and what can only be called a filling lunch, involving more cabbage than we're used to.  The building felt unloved, as other reviewers have said, but there were some lovely paintings and sculptures. The lack of English language information meant I spent a fair bit of time looking for a signal on my phone searching Wikipedia for information about the Portuguese artists and their works, which I did find and was interested to read. For example, it was sad to read of the fate of Henrique Pousao, who died of TB in his 20s. He went to Capri in the hopes his health would improve, and there are some excellent examples of his work while there.  My husband particularly liked an upstairs gallery with furniture in the French style. It is not a large gallery, so we only spent an hour viewing the paintings etc, and felt we had seen it all.","Not Aimed at the English Speaking Tourist","2019-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/56/b2/a3/liverpoolval-c.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/56/b2/a3/liverpoolval-c.jpg","29","0","18","11","9","23","0","63","2008-09-27T17:59:36-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.790C962108BA49E34A5BE654E67A55FF","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","790C962108BA49E34A5BE654E67A55FF","528793","Stockport, United Kingdom","LiverpoolVal_C","en","false","2019-04-06T09:52:04-04:00","3","The museum has mainly 19 th century art and some lovely sculptures.

   This is Portugal's first Art Museum (1833) and is housed in the 18th century Palace of Carrancas. The exhibition comprises of paintings, sculptures, jewellery, furniture and other objects d'art that were collected from extinct monasteries, Royal Palaces etc.
   We found that during our visit that we were the only visitors in the museum at the time so there was no problem in taking our time looking at the exhibits if we wanted to. The first section of the Palace consisted of paintings and sculptures of the highest quality especially the paintings by Henrique Pousao, I saw more works of this artist when we visited Lisbon a few days later. The second section contained jewellery, gold and silverware, glassware and ceramics demonstrating the richness and fineness of Portuguese craftsmanship.
   We thought overall that this collection was fabulous to see and wished that we had a bit more time for our visitation.","Fabulous art collection of Portugal's first Art Museum","2018-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","94","0","0","14","530","9","0","117","2017-05-20T15:23:06-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6D4C6475FECFA94C275827A12499027A","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","6D4C6475FECFA94C275827A12499027A","186518","Dundee, United Kingdom","zubenel57","49","Museums",,,,,"#49 of 375 things to do in Porto","28","Art Museums",,,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189180-d243631-Reviews-Museu_Nacional_de_Soares_dos_Reis-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html","http://www.museusoaresdosreis.gov.pt/","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189180-d243631-Museu_Nacional_de_Soares_dos_Reis-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html"

The Forte is also reachable from the city center via the Tram (Électrico).

The  Forte de São Francisco Xavier is a defensive structure, built in the mid-1600's, under a commission by King John, and is still in excellent shape, and especially so, considering that it sits on a rocky outcropping, over the vast Atlantic Ocean. That outcropping is locally referred to as Praia do Queijo – the Beach of cheese, due to the rocks’ resemblance to a block of cheese. I did not see that likeness, but cannot argue with the description – perhaps it looks different, at different times of the day? We were there fairly early on a mid-September morning, so maybe a trick of the eye, or the light? The Forte was constructed on a much earlier building site, suggested to be Celtic in origin, and dating to the 6th Century.

Entrance fee to  the Forte de São Francisco Xavier is but  €0.50, however there is no literature available, and few informational signs.

The interior is quite interesting, and well-worth a look, if for no other reason that to understand the operational aspects of an early defensive fort. There were still a few cannons in place, and the views of the Atlantic Ocean, plus the shoreline up to Matosinhos are spectacular.

This is definitely a “must-see,” and with so much around it, well-worth the effort to get out here. While one can easily spend an hour in/around the  Forte de São Francisco Xavier, and the surrounding beach, they will already be within a stone’s throw of so many interesting sites, that the trip will be greatly rewarded.","Beautiful 17th Century Defensive Fort","2018-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","912","0","125","223","34686","1246","0","2381","2005-07-28T00:00:00-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97",,"0",,"0",,"user","F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97","31310","Phoenix, Arizona","The_Loup_Garou","en","false","2019-05-02T15:02:54-04:00","4","We visited Castelo do Queijo, or Forte de São Francisco Xavier, but also just the “Castle of the Cheese” on our first full day in Oporto. Our guide/driver had circled down from Matosinhos, and its beach, and parked almost in front of the Castle, for us to explore this area. It was a bright, sunny September day, and because it was a Monday (also at the start of a taxi strike), the Castle was not crowded, nor was the beach.

We were told that the Castle/Fort got its rather peculiar name from the rock outcrop, on which it was built. It was also built on same site as a much older structure, probably also some type of fortification, from the 6th, or 7th Century. I was glad that our driver was a great tour guide, as none of that information was available at the Castle. However, with the insanely low cost of €0.50, I would not expect a lot of signs, and placards.

On the upper ramparts, there are still a few cannons, but the two prime features are the exterior architecture (built from native stone, probably quarried up the Douro River), and then the view from the Castle.

Well worth the stop, and besides, it sits on a beautiful beach!","Neat, Imposing Fort - Right on the Beach","2018-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/46/6b/e1/the-loup-garou.jpg","912","0","125","223","34686","1246","0","2381","2005-07-28T00:00:00-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97",,"0",,"0",,"user","F87FFE96E65803C04A8B1E3C62ED2C97","31310","Phoenix, Arizona","The_Loup_Garou","en","false","2019-03-28T02:31:27-04:00","3","If you are travelling on the city tour buses this worth a short stop to stretch your legs, and at a cost of only 0.5€ it will not break the bank.

It mattered not at all whether one was a converso or not, if the bloodline had Jewish origins, all bets were off.  The Zarco plaza in front of the fortress is named for this accomplished leader of the highest order.  But there was always the issue of his lineage.  

Just as an interesting aside here, our guide added that Christopher Columbus (well-known to the world) was a student of Prince Henry's, and his real family name was Salvador Fernandes Zarco (converso origins).  Mystery always makes for a good story.

The current exhibition has pieces from the archive of Museu da Cidade and the former Museu Municipal do Porto – Portugal’s first public museum, set up in 1848 – with origins in Museu Allen, which had pieces from the collector that showed an eclectic interest, research and curiosity, characteristic of Romanticism.

Each room has its own theme and description with unusual artifacts: fans of the period, inlaid boxes, shell combs, textiles, and the current star: an entire room called the Cabinet of Curiosities that surprised and delighted our senses and sense of global adventure in its displays. Exhibitions change often, while the staff is committed to our understanding and enjoyment of the Romantic Period. Located on the leafy grounds of the Crystal Palace, the gardens offer a clear view of the city and an elegant upscale restaurant, Antiqvvm with classic Portuguese cuisine and regional wines--advance reservations and time needed.","“Well Curated, Thoughtful Collection”","2022-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","68","0","3","38","5","117","0","223","2012-08-20T16:31:06-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.EE78038A3D83BFFCCC358A21BA8FD0C5","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","EE78038A3D83BFFCCC358A21BA8FD0C5","35805","Chicago, Illinois","mummblingme","en","false","2022-05-30T05:54:04-04:00","1","All there was at this museum was paintings and different objects that did not go with the house.
