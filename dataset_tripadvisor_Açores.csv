Boat was top notch as was the fishing gear.  Left right in time at 1300 and put the gear in the water quickly.    Deck hand Carlos and Philippe used every means imaginable to find fish, visual sighting of local birds that follow bait fish, fish finding electronic equipment, other people fishing via phone.... Alas we did not catch a tuna it was not for lack of trying... Philippe was much more interested in catching a fish than getting back to the harbor at the time out of our half day trip.  

I'd reccomend these people to anybody on Sau Migel looking for an enjoyable trip.  Would have been great to catch a big tuna.... however as always win some lose some.","Great trip with a great crew and first rate equipment.","2022-10",,"en","false","2022-10-15T08:32:15-04:00","5","We did the 1 hour boat tour of the island.

Although we were unable to bring a fish to the boat, they worked very hard constantly to find fish. Filipe's is very passionate about the client having a great experience.
I will try again.....

He has a wonderful, warm personality. He and Mariana were awesome. The experience was far beyond what we ever expected. We can’t wait to go back!","Huge tuna catch!

Espetacular. Se voce e pescador e quer AQUELE peixao... va com o Felipe. Vale bem a pena. O Felipe trabalha o barco sem descanso a procura e nao desiste.  A Mariana tambem   sempew a procura do passaro a trabalhar a isca. Fomos ontem e demorou, mas como digo, o homem nao desiste e la apanhamos o Peixao que eu queria. 5 estrelas. Recomendo.

5 stars. This Captain works his boat tirelessly to get you that fish you are after. Top grade gear, shimano and okuma reels, outriggers, up to date navionics and lowrance systems. Boat is clean and well maintained. 
The mandir not give up until I had my Bigeye... I'm chuffed. Highly Recomended.  If you have fished big game before you won't be disappointed.  If its your first time out for big game fish, don't be put off by the amount it costs, the gear, fuel, maintenance etc. Warrants the value and when you have the 250 pound fish pulling drag you will be happy you went.","Excellent Big game fishing experience","2022-09",,"en","false","2022-09-22T10:38:29-04:00","5","My fiends and I went ""Big Game fishing"" with AzorSea. I can confidently say that this is an amazing and unique experience. Fillipe and Mariana know very well what they are doing and don't give up even if you are sailing for 3 hours without a single fish. Thanks to Fillipe's experience, we finally managed to catch a fish. We let this one back into the sea afterwards.
Definitely recommended!","Amazing","2022-09",,"en","false","2022-09-17T11:41:59-04:00","5","This trip with Filipe was amazing and great! Me and my boyfriend ordered big game fishing for one day and we really enjoyed this day. We caught nice tuna and we saw a lot of dolphins during all day. The services from captain were great, we had a lot of fun a Filipe did his the best.
When we will go back to Azores, we will order another day with Filip, that's for sure!
I can recommend this trip for 100%.

Filipe brought us along the coastline of Sao Miguel. During our fishing trip there was a fishing competition. We heard the news that no-one in this competition was able to catch a fish. Quickly, it became clear that catching a fish would not be an easy challenge on that day.

Firstly, we had to look for the presence of particular animals in order to seek the tuna. Things like this really showed the fishing experience and knowledge of Filipe. Even though the conditions were not optimal and the competitors of the fishing competition were not able to catch a fish, we were able to catch a lot of fish.
It was very nice to see that the fish we caught was left behind as unharmed as possible. Just as it should be.

We went on this trip with a group of 5 friends and we all agreed that this was by far the best experience we had during our vacation. That’s why I really, really recommend this activity.
For now it’s time to quit reading reviews about Azorsea adventures and to go book a trip with Felipe!😉","Amazing fishing trip","2022-09",,"en","false","2022-09-14T11:19:38-04:00","5","They're not much more to say, except for it being absolut amazing. Philippe is an amazing person, that takes his time to make it to the best trip possible for you. From showing princess island, to diving for underwater volcanos. Even tho I wasn't fond of diving like the rest, he tried to adapt so I didn't miss a thing.

Philipe is an extemely skilled captain and got us up close to many incredible views and photo op's.  Swimming down (just 3m) to scoop up hot sand from a submerged volcano was SUPER cool!

On the island of Terceira we did a tour on the E bikes. We were guided by Jaime Vargas from Azores Nature Tours. Jaime started his company this year. He is a very enthousiastic guide who wants to show and tell all nice places on the part of the island you can visit during the tour. 
We wanted to see a lot of the island, So we asked him to spend not to much time in Praia Vittoria. After the bike tour it is possible to make a walk through the city when you want. 
Jaime is very flexibel, So talk with him what you prefer to see. 
His bikes were great. They make it easy to climb the hills.  We did a tour of 2 hours and saw a nice part of the island and the coast. So: this is a good way to explore a part of the island in a short time.

The atiPICO website has tons of information about the climb so that you can prepare beforehand and know exactly what you are getting yourself into. Everything is clearly stated and all our questions were answered (even ones that we did not think of). As a result, there were no unpleasant surprises on the day of our climb. Additionally, atiPICO tries to keep their group size to 8 per guide. Sometimes this is not possible due to weather or rescheduling. This makes the experience much more enjoyable because you can develop more of a camaraderie with your fellow climbers. We saw other guides with huge groups and were glad that we weren't being led by them. 

Nuno was our guide for the day and he was very professional and affable. While you could tell that he loved the Azores, Pico Island and what he does for a living, he was just a regular guy that you might meet and have a conversation with. You could tell he is very experienced at guiding the less experienced by the tips and tricks he gave to help us conserve energy and minimize strain on our knees. He helped us maintain a steady pace without putting undue pressure on the slower members of the group (me!). He was extremely observant and attentive without being overbearing. Nuno is also a wonderful storyteller and conversationalist and kept us entertained with stories about his life, family, travels, and past climbs. All this while maintaining strict safety standards for all of our group! He also speaks multiple languages so communication was easy.

I was particularly nervous about this climb as it is the most challenging activity that I've ever attempted but Nuno quickly put our group at ease. I highly recommend booking with atiPico if you care at all about having a great time and being safe!","Day climb with Nuno","2022-09",,"en","false","2022-09-13T00:48:01-04:00","5","It was an amazing experience with a great guide that tells you all ins and outs of climbing the mountain.

Nuno is a great guy, making the trip to the top a very enjoyable experience. With more than 450 climbs so far, and 11 years of hiking and climbing experience, he knows his way around the mountain and led us all the way to the top in around 3.5 hours and similar on the way down. He helped us to keep a good rhythm, maintained nice conversation and told us many stories from his climbs as well as facts related to the mountain’s and island’s flora and fauna!

All in all, we’ve had a fantastic time climbing up and down mount Pico and felt safe every step of the way!

We booked our climb in advance and before the climbing day we had to deal with some challenges (personal ones, nothing with Atipico). They were absolutely flexible and supportive and thanks to this we managed to join them for a climb. The climb itself was cancelled first due to weather conditions (which is completely understandable in the middle of the Atlantic ocean) and we liked very much how this company dealt with it. In one hand we really had the impression that they keep the “safety first” in mind. In the other hand they made every effort to find another slot for us before the end of our holiday and finally we had an amazing experience. Our guide was Daniel and he is a professional and experienced guide knowing the mountain very well.

My wife was a bit scared on the way down, but Nuno took special care to guide her steps down the steep slopes. In addition to this, he had an in depth knowledge of the volcano and the island, which he enthustiastically shared with us.","Wonderful trip with a wonderful guide","2022-08",,"en","false","2022-08-16T13:38:57-04:00","5","If you decide to climb Pico, I highly recommend doing it with a guide due to the rugged terrain, strenuous climb (i.e., knowing when to turn back) and high chance of bad weather/getting lost in the fog. Everyone visiting is required to wear GPS, have the proper footwear and carry at least 1.5L of water.  

I had the time of my life crossing off this bucket list item thanks to my guide Nuno and his wife Mónica at Atipico Azores who guided me and also taught me how to move cows out of the road with my car. :) As a solo traveler I felt so much more comfortable going with them! 

Not only are they great guides but also knew a ton about local endemic species of birds + plants!

Nuno is a great conversationalist and very knowledgeable about the local flora and fauna (especially birds), geology, and the Azores in general.  We learned a lot!  Lastly, our rental car fell through and they helped us arrange a taxi so we wouldn't miss the hike, then helped us get to Lajes after the hike.

We got to the meet-up early, and saw several other companies going out with 15 or more people. (Foreshadowing, the other outfits held us all up at various points because they took on too many people of too many varying capabilities). Epic Adventures was quick to reply to my initial request and worked with me to find the right time/date/adventure that worked for our desired fun-goals. Having canyoned before in other countries, I was shocked at the safety of everything and the extremely high quality and newness of all the gear. It was fabulous! The gear was just unheard of with other groups we've done this with in other places. They were super informative, super friendly, and just so much fun to work with in a SMALL GROUP. The size of their groups sets them apart -- they don't run 15+ people at once. They make sure the attendees are matched and a small group so everyone has the best experience. It was clear - after seeing the other outfits on site -- that Epic Adventures was above and beyond the others. And, we did some things differently than the generic other outfits. I can't say enough good things, and I've learned to research what gear they offer, and the group size. Epic has it all, and I can't wait to do it again when I come back. (Also, it was raining when we canyoned... it made it so much better... don't back out if it's raining. Extra waterfalls.

But Mother Nature had other plans in store for us. The weather was overcast, a bit rainy and foggy. Our wonderful, very knowledgeable and a proud Azorean tour guide Eduardo explained honestly that as we climbed elevation towards Sete Cidades the fog would become thicker. So he recommended another way to turn this unfavorable situation into a positive experience- and it brilliantly did. Being a jeep tour, he took us off-road where we got to see villages along the coast, the countryside and island gems that we would never have dreamt doing ourselves. Having such a tour guide who wants to show you the best the island offers is a sure winner.

Mariano knows so much about the island and told us little interesting facts a long the way that I fee other tour guides don’t do. Like he stopped to have us a fee a bush and explained the softer leaves are the flowers. I liked that added detail and I felt like I learned a lot on the tour and we saw amazing sites. It was just me and my friend since we were his first tour of the season and I told him we like walking and saw one of the sites on the tour already so he changed the tour a bit and we hiked to a lake we haven’t a seen and also hiked to one of the waterfalls. It was a great experience. Lunch was excellent, choice of fish or beef and if you do a tour on a Friday I think they have a buffet. When we were going through the woods in nordeste the tree cutters had this big truck blocking the way and it looked impossible to cross and Mariano worked it out with them and it was a fragile situation since we were on a cliff. It all worked out and we passed and then on the way back a tree fell and blocked our way! He called and a forester came and chopped down the tree. What an adventure.

While on Sao Miguel we spent several days on tour with Daniel Cabral, guide extraordinarre from GreenZone Tours.  We did not do a ""tour"" listed on trip advisor.  Instead, we had booked guided tours for 2.5 days with the details left to the tour company in discussion with us.  We met Daniel on our first afternoon and he was our guide for the entire time on Sao Miguel.  We discussed with Daniel the types of activities we wanted. He tailored our days to include exactly what we wanted and even more.  Each day was longer than the amount of time we had booked because he wanted us to see and experience everything Sao Miguel had to offer--and that is quite a lot. Daniel made the trip truly extraodinary.  We were picked up and dropped off right at the hotel and Daniel planned our days.  We loved the nature, the history, the culture and all of our activities--from hiking, bathing in thermal baths in Furnas, and ""water tasting"" at caldeira do vulcao dos furnas.  I had mentioned how much I liked the bread known as bolos levedos, and Daniel even went to the bakery that is famous for this type of bread and bought us some.

Eddy was informative and a pleasure to spend half a day with taking 4 of us around the rim of the volcanic crater with views over the entire crater and the two lakes below, before heading down to the bottom of the crater through the lush green landscape.  We also drove through some of the villages before finally getting Eddy to recommend a local sea front restaurant for lunch.  We asked him to join us (not part of the tour) and he ensured we experienced an amazing meal of many of the local seafood delicacies as well as local steak.

We can't speak highly enough about our guide, Michael de Rosa, who's knowledge and passion for his adopted city was apparent at evert moment. We owe to him one particular recommendation; the extraordinary Restaurant Magna, at the Hotel Senhora De Rosa. 
Our one quibble with the experience is the the food at each of the stops was not exceptional. Good, satisfying, filling, but not memorable. 
Our sense was that the restaurants were excellent, but they didn't serve their best to the tour group at any of the stops along the way. 
One note of appreciation to Michael- he made especial mention of the one and only synagogue in Ponta Delgada, the oldest such in the Azores, now a museum only of the fascinating story of the Jewish presence there and on the mainland.
We highly recommend a visit to all with an interest in Portuguese /European history and Jewish history.

Took us on a beautiful walk around the island where we got to know all the secrets of the places. Antonio exceeded expectations and it was an experience we all love. He gave us a history lesson. We are all amazed and eager to return. We advise lunch with him so he can tell the secrets of gastronomy of Terceira. The next day we made the walking trail of the Mistérios Negros and it's impossible to not be in love with the island. Such beautiful landscapes... Azor-In provided us the best experience we had in the Azores, ever.","The best way to meet the island","2018-07",,"42","Tours","61","Outdoor Activities",,,,,,,"#15 of 333 Outdoor Activities in Azores","183","Walking Tours","235","Private Tours","139","Sightseeing Tours","220","Nature & Wildlife Tours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"OPERATOR","<span class=""highlight"">Tours from Azor-In tend to sell out</span> - travelers recommend booking in advance!","Atlantic/Azores",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189136-d14204711-Reviews-Azor_In-Terceira_Azores.html","http://www.azor-in.pt","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189136-d14204711-Azor_In-Terceira_Azores.html"

My husband and I travel extensively and have done dozens of memorable tours, mostly private, but none come close to our experience yesterday with Juca & Marisa at Azores Expeditions. They were responsive to our inquiries and questions before booking. They made their schedule work for us then spent the entire day not just showing us all the amazing places but also educating us on fun facts and history.

Marisa, born and raised on Terceira, is the most knowledgeable about the island. And Juca, Photography is his passion. He captured some incredible photos and videos of us, even took time to teach us how to use our phones and editing tools to create next level images ourselves. It felt so refreshing to spend over 8 hours hitting up sooo many destinations with someone who maintained high energy and kept us entertained and upbeat the entire time.

Whether you're a solo traveler, family or group, you won't go wrong choosing Azores Expeditions to show you and teach you about the best Terceira has to offer. And you must definitely will get your money's worth. Just tell them what you're interested in and they'll create the most memorable experience for you.

Reservations and communication with Marisa was so easy and prompt. Of all the tours I've been on, Juca's was by far the best tour I've ever had. I enjoyed 3 days of the customized experience. Terceira is prone to inclement weather, and he was able to optimize our activities based on current conditions. Juca is a kind, smart, knowledgeable, considerate and fun travel buddy.  I booked my trip to Azores on a whim, after being burned out by work and life, and didn't have enough brain cells to plan in advance. I gave Juca full rein to plan my days, and he made my trip truly unforgettable.  Waterfalls, sunrises, private cave tours, swimming holes, hikes, delicious food, church tours...my days were packed with beautiful views, cultural history, natural history, adventure, and laughing my butt off at his humor. His photography skills alone are worth the tour price--Juca is definitely an OG here and have inspired many others (tip: if you want some beautiful photos, wear clothes in solid, bright colors - blue, yellow, red, etc).  I could have easily booked a full week and still have so much more to do, but 3 days was plenty of time to enjoy a taste of Terceira without feeling too rushed or overwhelmed.

I ended up doing it again with Juca and of course it was unforgettable. It may be a little more expensive compared to other companies, but I tell you, it's worth every single euro.

We can see how much Juca loves his work and his island. It was a great privilege again to take a tour with him, because he knows a lot of things about the island. Photography, geology, archaeology and culture, it's a master.

Of course, all this has been possible also thanks to Marisa a very sweet and professional organization.

Juca is punctual, we started with the hike (highly recommended) then moved on to Duck’s Lake and I thought the trip was coming to an end after a late lunch at Caneta, but we went on to see Biscoitos Natural Pool. Juca was kind enough to speak with one of the vendors to keep an eye on my belongings when I come by the next day for a swim. Then we went Alvar do carvão, Furnas do Enxofre and ended the trip at black forest. It was certainly a full day trip.

Showed the photos taken by Juca to my friends and family, everyone agrees that the photos are well taken :). There is a minimum charge for 2 person but based on the amount of time spent, photos and effort from Juca and Marisa, it is well worth the price and I will gladly do the tour with them again.","Great value and photos!","2020-09",,"en","false","2020-01-03T02:47:25-05:00","5","We are so fortunate to have had the opportunity to tour with Trilhas Outdoor Adventure Tours and Juca. After doing some research ahead of time, it was clear that working him and his business would be ideal. 

It almost didn’t materialize however; after having to reschedule (since we lost two days the day of our tour due to a cancelled flight) as the weather was so poor on the date of our rescheduled tour. 

Juca made the trip to our hotel (on New Year’s Day) to meet with us and discuss whether we wanted to tour or not, given that the weather was miserable and wouldn’t likely improve. He felt this was an appropriate conversation to have in person rather than to have over text or email. 

While it would have been rather easy to convince us to go, anyway (since it was our last full day on the island). Juca expressed that he didn’t feel that it would be fair to take our money, given the situation. 

For my wife and I, the honesty and integrity that was exhibited had won us over. We promised that if we returned, we would certainly book with Trilhas and while sad, we really looked forward to coming back and appreciated the honesty. 

Later that evening, we received a message from Marisa, Juca’s wife. There had been a cancellation and they wanted to see if they could give us a half-day tour that we could do before our flight home. 

Logistically, Marisa and Juca made it as easy and as pragmatic as possible by arranging that we meet at the airport so that we could get the most out of our time, which was a big help. 

As far as the experience itself, we couldn’t have been more impressed. Juca carries a kind and friendly energy that is incredibly welcoming. As we explored the island, he was well-equipped with an wide array of information, helpful context, interesting stories and funny jokes. 

The thing that was massively appreciated was that typically when we travel, I stay behind the lens and there are rarely any photos of my wife and I together, save for the random selfie. Juca exhibited a wizardry with the iPhone that neither of us knew existed, while also providing a number of helpful tidbits that I could use with my camera as well. 

He was mindful and caring, funny and welcoming. He showed us plenty of highlights around the island in a rather condensed format that at the same time never felt rushed or forced.  On top of that, we have a number of fantastic photos that we never would have imagined being able to take on our own. It felt as though we were traveling with a close family friend. We were totally comfortable and fully engaged during the time we spent. 

We can’t wait to come back again to visit and when we do, without question, we’ll be sure to reach out to Marisa and Juca once again!

We finally got a flight to Lajes on the 24th and made it to the wonderful Island of Terceira. We were worn out...mentally and physically exhausted and with no clothes to speak of (Our luggage was finally found, but it seems to have been left out in the rain and everything in the suitcase including the suitcase was soaked & mildewed).

PICO MTN CLIMB. I’m going to preface this by saying I was NOT prepared for this technical a climb. I love to hike, and am ok with steep and a lot of cardio - but I found the mental side of this overbearing. Thank god for our amazing guide Matteo. He has climbed it 650 times!!! So he was amazingly supportive when I had a panic attack halfway up and helped me thru it. I was also terrified the whole way down (way harder than going up, btw) but he had me hold onto his backpack and talked the whole way so I was distracted. I definitely would have needed the the mountain rescue team if it were not for him. THANK YOU MATTEO!!!

PICO WINE TOUR: What a lovely day. We started at 9.30a and I was a little nervous about hitting the bottle that early, but luckily for me the morning ended up being more of a tour and learning about the island. Then we went to a lovely lunch and the wine commenced! It was very good. We then went and tried Liquer which I was not a big fan of - would have preferred more wine - but still fun to try.

Having not access to a car on Pico, we were looking for a tour that could give us a full and adventurous experience, our eyes landed on the “Secret Lagoon and Lava Cave Tours” and we were not disappointed! We started the morning with exploring two caves with Raisa, our guide. The two caves we visited are only known by some locals so we got to explore over 700m of caves just by ourselves. Raisa was very knowledgeable on the subject and we were provided with great gear to explore without being afraid of hurting ourselves and getting ourselves dirty. After the cave exploration, Raisa brought us to a local restaurant where we got to try some very nice food from the Azores. The afternoon we got to explore a large portion of the islands; some hidden lagoons (since sometime the fog just hides it from everyone), the coast where we really got to appreciate the remains of the eruption and the solidified lava. Raisa also made us try some local wine as she wanted to make sure we couldn’t leave Pico without trying at least a glass of wine from there.

We also had initially planned to do the Pico Night Climb later that day, but the weather was unfortunately not on our side. We instead got rebooked on the Pico Day Climb the next day which was great none the less. They taught us about some plants, gave us a taste of the local drink, and got us all the way to the top in a good pace. Bring lots of Water, Snacks and Lunch!

Matteo, our extremely experienced guide (500+ hikes to Pico Mountain) picked us up and drove us to the Mountain House. On the way he showed the weather forecast and what to expect, always good to manage expectations as the weather can be tricky. He arranged everything once there making our life’s very easy, specially at that time of the day. 

During the hike he explained the different parts, with names and difficulty, and managed our pace to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. He also know the mountain better than his living room so he went on the easiest parts, with short cuts 😁.

Not only that, he is also a very knowledgeable climber and we were lucky enough to get a 7 summit 101 class on our way back, making the time go by super fast.

Just to top it off he spent the day taking videos and pictures that are just the perfect way to remember this day, and it takes that off your hands so you just have to enjoy the view.

100% recommended if you are planning to do this hike. He is all passion and knowledge, and managed to keep us smiling all the way.

Best Spot was well reviewed and did not disappoint.

Silvia and Camila instructed our group for the first two dives, making sure we were comfortable with the requisite skills (and in my case, the realities of diving from a boat).  They also added a saltwater confined water dive for me, which was again very useful for getting the feel of the full equipment without the complexities of open water.

Rúben then guided our group for the third and fourth dives around Caloura (Galera and Arches), adapting the route to our confidence and air consumption (giving me an extra 20 minutes on the second dive).  I’m not a marine biologist so can’t really comment on the wildlife, but I loved the underwater scenery.  I chose the Azores having had a wonderful holiday in Iceland, so being able to “fly” through the familiar volcanic landscape was magical.

Overall, I was very pleased with the service Best Spot provided, and would highly recommend them to anyone else doing their PADI Open Water.","Staff very friendly and welcoming but also professional.","2022-09",,"42","Tours","55","Boat Tours & Water Sports","61","Outdoor Activities",,,,,"#4 of 135 Boat Tours & Water Sports in Azores","194","Scuba & Snorkeling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/animal-welfare-education-portal/","Learn more","Click below for expert advice on animal welfare in tourism.","This attraction features animals","Features Animals","OPERATOR","<span class=""highlight"">Tours from Best Spot Azores Dive Center tend to sell out</span> - travelers recommend booking in advance!","Atlantic/Azores",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189135-d4428174-Reviews-Best_Spot_Azores_Dive_Center-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html","http://www.bestspotazores.com","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189135-d4428174-Best_Spot_Azores_Dive_Center-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html"

Unless you want to hike 14-30 km (and we are hikers, but the humid climate of the Azores makes everything harder)  it's actually better to have Silvio drive you to the beginning of the hike and pick you up at the end. 

If staying in Faja Grande, three hiking trails begin there, so Silvio can drive you to the end of the hike and you can walk back to your accommodation for a very reasonable price (20-30 per route for the two of us). 
Silvio also gives great advice on tours to Corvo, restaurants and accommodation and can often make the booking for you.

We got it all and MORE with Lara and Rodrigo.
From start to finish, they provided us exactly what my friend and I were hoping for in our full day ride. I can't even say what my favorite part was because it was ALL amazing... the jungle, the villages, the ocean views, a healthy and delicious picnic overlooking the sea while the horses happily ate their lunch, exhilarating gallops while we laughed for joy, the cool history of the islands Lara told us, seeing things no tourist could, and our small group of 4. It felt like going out for a ride with friends. 
And again... their attitude was that the horses come FIRST. The horses are happy and healthy and fit and know and love their jobs. Their workload is carefully monitored and they have proper time off. It is not often a company has so much integrity and passion for their jobs and horses that they would turn away business for the sake of small, personized groups and the care of the horses.

Lara was also very patient with me already in the first place, since i was working in Sao Miguel for the summer and my  free days were changing all the time, But she answered all my emails and was just very kind and understanding. 
When we arrived Lara showed us the barn, told us more about horses, about their personallities and health conditions, which was really nice. After that we drove to a place where we started a ride. 
The place was amazing, horses were calm and responsive and we just had a really good time. What I liked the most was that horses were in good condition, it seems like they have a good life here in Azores :) and also that they are doing tours in small groups - it keeps the quality of the tour high.

Thanks to her advice we came well prepared for a climb with all different weather conditions and made it to the top. As Belgian tourists it was very nice to have a Dutch-speaking guide.

Each walk was handmade for me and each walk was absolutely perfect. When Steffi saw that I was getting very tired, she would ask us to stop, always in the most beautiful space, and  gave me the most delicious lemonade and the most marvellous buiscuits made by her, that gave me the energy to keep on going.

The hike up and down isn't easy, but at the top, your effort is more than rewarded.  
Steffi from Hominis Natura was a fabulous and considerate guide as well as being a great and helpful host to us.

I really, trully , enjoyed it. They are very arranging, well equiped, careful about the weather conditions and very attentive to the people hiking with them (physical condition, gear, ...).

I did 2 activities : Climbing Pico and a Cave Tour.

Climbing Pico can be very tough for most of us and as much as it was impressive, i always felt secured. They really care and adapt their pace to the people. I also went down some amazing caves, Lava tunnels created during volcanic erruptions and it was mind blowing. Again here, i felt priviledge to be guided by someone so careful,  and very knowledgeable. 

Price wise, i think it was totally worth it and not expensive compared to other organizations.

Fortunately for us Steffi and Nilton offer climbs at this time of the year. On the day of the climb my wife had stomach issues but decided to try anyway. We were about 20 minutes into the climb when my wife decided she could not continue. (Turns out she had mild food poisoning.) Milton took her back down to the station and made sure she was well enough to drive back to the hotel. Steffi took the rest of us (two of us in all) to the top. The Katabatic winds racing down the slope were phenomenal and made the climb more challenging. We reached the summit of Piquino in under 3 hours and lunched on the lee side with the thermal vents offering us some heat. The trip down was a little more challenging since I had injured my lateral collateral ligament while snowboarding making each step  a new adventure in pain, but nothing you can do except grin and bear it. We made it down in just over two hours. Since I had now way to get back, Nilton and Steffi gave me a ride back to the hotel for which I was very grateful. It was overall an excellent adventure and Steffi and Milton are excellent guides. It is a technically challenging climb and you don’t want to fall because falling on lava rock will hurt badly so bring good boots.  Thanks Steffi and Nilton for a great climb.","Great challenging climb in fog and wind!","2022-02",,"en","false","2022-03-06T01:19:47-05:00","5","We had a great time going all the way to the top of Pico - even though the climb is hard, specially on the way down! Steffi was super helpful from the start - we initally booked a night climb, but due to the strike with the ferry boats, we had to change it to a day climb. No problem! We met the dat after around 8.30 at Casa da Montanha (all hikers need to register there) and Steffi was waiting for us with extra gear - which basically saved us during the climb 😅😅 
The climb itself was very beautiful - Steffi always made sure we were feeling well, had enough water and were comfortable continuing (the weather was not the best on that day). She explained us the landscape and told us funny stories about previous hikes :) time flew by and when we noticed we could already see the top of the mountain. The last part you have to do proper climbing, but don't worry as Steffi will help you all the way. The view at the top is very beautiful (although it was quite cloudy, if you have lots of time in Azores - try to be flexible to get the best day to go all the way up). We had lunch at the top and Steffi had warm coffee with her - which was the best treat in the cold weather :)
The way down is a bit harder, you're feeling more tired, but it's equally beautiful. 
Thank you Steffi for taking us safely all the way to the top, all the amazing Açores tips and most of all for your good energy :)

I highly recommend this tour! The island and the tour were visually beautiful.  The pace of the tour was very well timed.  We were never rushed.

Jose was an excellent host and guide and was very fun to be with.  He is super knowledgeable and experienced from history, geology, food, culture and life!  

We experienced great scenery, vistas, a short hike, a spectacular local lunch, multiple spring water tastings (who knew?), incredible thermal baths, a tea plantation and tasting, and lots and lots of history. If you go to San Miguel, please take this tour with Jose.  It was the best part of our 3 day stay on the island.  Thank you Jose!!!

Absolutely knowledged about history, nature and current political situation, he act nearly as a wikipedia of the Azores. He listen to what his clients are looking for and does almost everything to please them. We have had a great day out with him and even extra service at the evening. I cannot judge other tour providers, but Carpe Diem and José seem to be perfect. Nothing else, but nothing less.

Muito obrigado José! Great day, great dinner at the location you recomended.

Our first private tour to Furnas was so good we had to book a further private tour to Sete Cidades a week later.

Everyone in our family could not speak highly enough of Jose and the effort he subtly put into our days to ensure we had the best possible experience. 

It was so relaxed and definitely went above and beyond any tour we have ever done.

Next time we are back in the Azores we will definitely be back in touch with Jose to arrange another tour.

Jose took us to soo many things we never would have known existed without him, including an incredible local lunch in a town inside of a crater. He is so knowledgeable and excited about sharing what he knows. He even added a stop at the end to the pineapple plantation because we had talked about it during the tour.

Jose, the owner of this company, and is a solo operator , was very accommodating, knowledgeable and extremely hospital person. We were lucky, since no other people joined us and the tour become a private. He mentioned at the beginning of the journey that his trip always are on guest's wishes, schedules, no rush. He showed all the interesting spots: we went to the peak of the volcano and observed the stunning views of the seven lakes drove to unpaved roads thanks to his superior 4X4 all-terrain Nissan while explaining the history, flora and fauna, traditions and current developments in St. Miguel. We have a great lunch the traditional Azores food wine, beer, etc. and then continued to the ocean part, Mosteiros where we were swimming in natural thermal pools with the direct access to the ocean - amazing experience, much better than Caldeira Velha we went their 2 days before this trip and were very disappointed. One interesting fact - since Jose spent almost his entire carrier as a supervisor for the local water authority, he showed us a couple of the water wells and explain how the whole system works - very insightful and interesting part of our journey with Jose. We were back to our hotel around 7:30-8.00 pm, and we very lucky to have this trip with Carpe Diem.

The only disappointment that we booked this trip as the last day before leaving San Miguel - the early dates were unavailable in Viator Jose is very popular and his trips are always in high demand.

He grew up on the island and is extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of São Miguel, from geology to wildlife to daily life and history. He is a genuinely lovely person and a wonderful storyteller. We felt thoroughly taken care of all day and appreciate his ‘no rush’ approach. On top of that we learned so much and explored so many places and views we never would have been able to do on our own with a rental car. We went on a full day Sete Cidades tour.

Jose took us round Sette Cidettes and Lake Fogo - and it was simply the best tour I have ever been on. We had a very foggy day but the scenery was still beautiful. With the weather, it could have been a terrible tour due to most of the view points showing us nothing but fog. However, Jose took us to lots of seemingly unknown places inside both craters and we had some beautiful views with no one else around! Having a 4WD car also helped a lot. Jose was attentive, courteous and so unbelievably knowledgeable; we honestly learned so much on the tour and felt comfortable asking questions on everything from economics to environmental protection. Jose gave us space and time to explore and not once did we feel rushed or like we were an inconvenience. He discussed the itinerary with us and tailored it to our interests. Words cannot describe how great Jose was, he took care of us from 9am-7pm and kept us engaged the entire time. My partner and I feel so lucky to have found Carpe Diem Dream Tours, Jose's passion for his island shone through and made the tour truly magical. Jose was also prepared for everything and had towels water and cookies for us! The buffet we went to was delicious and Jose accompanied us round to tell us about all the dishes - how many tour guides would do that!

José knows all there is to know about his beautiful island and taught us so much that we would never have found out through self guided travel. He really brought trips to Furnas and Sete Cidades volcanic craters to life and went out of his way to ensure we had the best time possible, despite the sometimes inclement weather.

While the climb is relatively strenuous for unexperienced hikers / climbers, the guides are incredibly helpful and accommodating. My girlfriend and I booked the overnight climbing, and we're very happy we did so, as it was a memorable and one-of-a-kind experience.

I want to give due credit to our guides Tim and Manuel, who were remarkable and absolutely essential in having us make the most of this activity. Early on in the hike, my girlfriend felt the climb would be too strenuous on her, and Manuel understood and gladly walked us back. Before we made it back, he paused and said that, after observing us better, he felt the issue might simply have been that my girlfriend's backpack was too heavy. After splitting some of its heavier items in his own backpack and my own, he suggested for us to try doing a bit more of the hike upwards, and if after a particularly challenging part of it my girlfriend still felt she couldn't do it, he'd walk us all the way back. This made all the difference, and allowed us to eventually reach the top, so a big shout-out to Manuel for his care and attention with us.

The overnight climb also allowed us to truly make the most of being at the peak. We were unlucky on the way up, having had mostly foggy and cloudy views, but the sunrise was absolutely gorgeous, and we had enough time at the top of Piquinho to truly take in the view from all angles without many clouds obstructing our view.

The activity was a satisfying test of strength which rewarded us with spectacular views, and Manuel's additional surprise at the top made it all even better.

I did the overnight climb with Pico Me Up's guide Manuel Goulart where we camped up in the crater at the top of the mountain and then summited Pico Pequeno at sunrise the next morning.

Manuel was an amazing guide, he's close to climbing the mountain 300 times - and he is incredibly knowledgeable, patient, helpful, and all around good guy. I felt very safe and secure with him in charge and learned a lot from him about the mountain and Pico (he's had family there since the 1700s!).

At the start of the hike, it was raining on the mountain. Manuel recommended hold off starting and see if the weather would clear and in the meantime brought us to check out two nearby lava tube/caves which were insanely cool. An hour later, the mountain was cleared of rain and clouds and we got started. It was really the best call, I'm so glad I didn't have to camp in wet clothes. 

I'm in pretty good shape, I run a lot, but this is definitely a challenging hike - more challenging on the way down because of the steep/uneven terrain and loose rocks, along with a backpack holding sleeping bags/food/water etc. Definitely not for a novice!

The views of Pico and Faial, the insanely mars-like landscape of the mountain itself, the sunset, the stars, the view above the clouds - I can't express enough how amazing this experience was.

We had another full day tour planned and it did not disappoint! 

I’ll focus on highlights from the day because I can’t fit everything we did into this one review!

Gabriele Vergani picked us up at 9am for a our tour and if you have a chance to request him as your guide in Terceira I highly recommend him! He personalized our day and was so knowledgeable about everything we asked...which is a challenge since I’m a biologist and ask some pretty crazy questions! Lol

1.) Monte Brasil - the views from this location were spectacular and driving through the gate to get up there was intense! I didn’t realize there was a guard, etc. Cool to see! 

2.) Natural pools in Biscoitos - we were there in October so the surf was huge! The only thing that changed was that we couldn’t get in the pools! But it didn’t change the scenery which was amazing! The surf crashing over the pools was beautiful! Totally worth the visit no matter the time of year!

3.) traditional food at Ti Choa - I can’t tell you the name of everything we ate because we tried 4 traditional dishes; one of which was Alcatra and it was sooo good!! It was all amazing! We had an amazing, hilarious waiter too! I only wish I would have gotten his name because he was great! 

4.) Algra do Carvao - this place was beyond words! To be inside an extinct volcano was humbling! It’s one of those things you have to experience for yourself! AND, our guide was not too embarrassed to be around us when we took out our travel pig! Lol

5.) Weird highlight for me was when a local was moving his goats right along the main road! Lol they just laid right down in the middle of the road! So cool to see this part of everyday life! 

There were so many other things we did throughout the day, but I can’t write about it all here! Amazing day overall!

Op elke vraag had hij een antwoord, we hebben veel geleerd over vulkanen en het eiland én over de geschiedenis van de eilanden, heerlijk gegeten, het was een topdag.

De 4x4 tour is aan te raden voor iedereen, en neemt je mee langs veel interessante punten van het eiland. Tiago - de gids - heeft enorm veel kennis, is super vriendelijk en een enorm toffe gids om de dag mee door te brengen. Tijdens de tour kom je op verschillende toeristische plekken die door zijn uitleg wat extra diepgang krijgen, maar ook op de wat minder bekende plekken zodat je het eiland écht leert kennen.

Daarnaast ook een wandelexcursie bij hem geboekt naar de Santa Barbera (hoogste berg/vulkaan van het eiland) en een mountainbiketour. De wandelroute is niet heel zwaar, maar vanwege het hoogteverschil niet aan te raden voor mensen die slecht te been zijn. Wel enorm leuk te doen: je doet een picknick met Tiago op het hoogste punt van het eiland met een uitzicht om 'u' tegen te zeggen.

De mountainbiketour was mijn favoriet. De route is zo'n 8 kilometer maar door het hoogteverschil best pittig. De natuur, het uitzicht en het gezelschap maken het wel 100% waard. Hoogtepunt tijdens deze tour was 'de Playground'; een oude steengroeve wat tegenwoordig op een soort skatepark lijkt. Zelfs voor beginnende mountainbikers is dit een mooie manier om jezelf een pro te wanen op de mountainbike.

Als je Terceira bezoekt en je geen excursie boekt bij ComunicAir, heb je eigenlijk een verloren vakantie. Tiago is hét voorbeeld voor wat een gids moet zijn: enorm vriendelijk met een boel kennis en humor.","4x4 tour, hiken en mountainbiken met een top gids!","2018-07",,"nl","false","2018-06-21T06:18:33-04:00","5","wij hebben 4x4tour  met nog een dame van over de 80 jaar geboekt bij Tiago en dit was een bijzonder en fijne dag.

Final stop was the exceptional Volcano Interpretation Centre of Capelinhos.

Before heading out on the RIB we had a talk about what we might see and what to expect, it was very educational. We were told that it was going to be a rough ride but we were asked before we went out if we would be ok with that, if not we could go another day. We decided to risk it, luckily we wore  the waterproofs provided by them so stayed dry. I have a bad hip but that was not a problem as Pedro and a member of his crew made sure I was helped on and off the boat safely, which meant a lot to me.  We saw sperm whales, hundreds of dolphins and a turtle. The next time we went out we added a blue shark and flying fish to the list of whales, dolphins and another turtle. 
Pedro is sensitive to the safety of his passengers and to the wildlife we saw. He never chased the wildlife and stayed a safe distance away so as not to frighten it. 
This was not our first trip with Pedro, we had been out with him 5 years ago, and because of his enthusiasm and awareness of the ocean  and his dedication to deliver an amazing experience we will definitely visit him again next time we are in the Azores.","Utterly amazing","2022-06",,"en","false","2022-06-28T01:17:49-04:00","5","To bad I can only give 5 stars.
I forgot the count of my trips with Pedro and his experienced crew, but coming over to Faial from the Netherlands especially for Azores Experiences, should say enough. To find whales and dolphins in the big ocean you have to rely on the knowledge and expertise of a good skipper. Pedro Filipe has amazed me every time I went on a trip with him and it has been worth the money every time. Because Azores Experiences is a small company they have excellent care and attention to all the people on the boat that can transport a group of 12/14. Which is also the amount I would recommend for a special and occasional moment like this. I also recommend everyone that visits Faial to go on a trip with Pedro.
Or advise people who wants to go whale watching to visit Faial and ask for Pedro. Rather have a good small professional company then a professional good looking company.

Pedro took us out in a fast boat across the bay to the other side of Pico island to look for whales and dolphins. 

The ride was thrilling but the equipment provided kept us dry. We saw the same whale twice but almost as beautiful were the groups of spotted dolphins who came up close to our boat. 

The next day we spent the day with Hugo in a Jeep. The itinerary had to change so that we were able to see the magnificent caldera. The visit to the exhibition in the lighthouse at Capelinhos was enhanced by Hugo our guide. The off road trips were excellent. The buffet lunch was filling.

Pedro and his stuff are passionate and careful professionals, very respectful both of their customers and of the sea life. And they are extremely nice and fun guys!

It was a fantastic experience and we particularly appreciated to be accompanied by dedicated and experienced scientists. The staff was not only passionate, professional and extremely knowledgeable, but they are also very kind and take the time to provide very interesting information. We also appreciate their very sustainable and respectful approach. They are doing a great job at transmitting their love for the ocean to their clients. Part of the resources they collect through the whale watching trips also serves to fund scientific projects. So if you are interested to watch whales and dolphins, and learn more about their lives and environments, I highly recommend you to book a trip with Naturalist Science and Tourism.

They are similar to the long-distance walks in the UK like the Pennine Way. However, in the Azores, they seem to be sited quite a distance from the main towns on the islands. So you usually have to make your own way to the start points and back from  the finish to your accommodation. 
And that's where you meet your first major obstacle - how to do this? Public transport  is just above primitive, usually rare and early-finishing. If you rent a car that is a significant extra cost to your holiday. Anecdotally, the tourist information office will advise you to arrange for a local taxi service to take you to the start point and advise you to arrange with the driver to pick you up at where you intend to finish and when. If you are hiking here in the Azores for the first time, that is a  tremendous ""leap of faith"". If anything goes wrong with you or your taxi, you are well and truly stranded. Who wants to spend an unexpected night in a bus shelter? It is of little consolation that there are no ""wild"", dangerous animals on these islands .
So what to do? Fortunately, there are many little companies offering their services as hiking guides and on Sao Jorge, ""Discovery Experience"" is a name you frequently come across and I was fortunate to have two days with them during my stopover there. The company is made up of Dina Nunes and Jorge Santos, a local couple that have been born and bred on the island but do not lack a worldly-wise outlook on life - Jorge is an ex-military man who has seen service for his country in some of Portugal's ""hot spot"" former colonies and Dina has done business studies at university in Lisbon.
My first day was with Jorge when the two of us did part of the ""Fajã de São João - Lourais - Fajã dos Vimes"". At the start, I was a little perturbed about Jorge's description of the walk as I imagined it to be a ""there-and-back"" walk. In this, I was mistaken, as Dina, who drove us to the start point, was going to take the minibus and meet us at the end , whenever we arrived. For me the fact that my concerns about the ""open-ended"" nature of the hike and the unknown nature of the trail itself were so quickly addressed, it made me feel that my guides were professional and more than competent to deal with any unforeseen problems that might occur during the day. The walk itself was quite challenging for me as we started at sea level, went as high as 450 metres and then went down to sea level again. During  this 10 km walk, I found Jorge to be an extremely genial guide and it was not long before we felt comfortable in each other's company and chatted about our own lives and the people in them. He was also full of information about the island - the people, the plants,  the geology, the history etc... That is how I learned of his military experience and the fact that he is a member of the island's volunteer fire brigade - he showed me a video on his mobile that was a ""live"" exercise that he had participated in the night before with the rest of the island's emergency services and military forces. If I'd had any remaining doubts about his capabilities, they vanished.
 When we got to Faja dos Vimes, Dina was waiting for us with the minibus as expected. While Jorge went off to jump into the Atlantic ocean to cool off, Dina took me to the coffee plantation that her family own for a much-needed cool, soft drink and a sample of the organic coffee they make there. The taste of this coffee that is made on Europe's only coffee plantation is well worth a visit. If you catch Dina in a talkative mood, she'll take you on a tour of the plantation and its fruit groves and you might even see her mother at work on one of the handbuilt looms that she uses to create her unique woven blankets.
The next day, Dina took me on a hike along the trail between Faja dos Cubres  and the Faja de Caldeira, a coastal walk that suited me after the previous day's exertions. She was just as talkative and easygoing company as her partner Jorge and put up with my frequent stops as another photo opportunity presented itself. This is a truly spectacular coastal walk and is well-worth it's reputation. When you get to the little church of Ermida de Santo Cristo that has been built on this headland of volcanic lava rock and have a drink of coffee in the local bar - the ""Taberna Conves"" - it is easy to relax and watch  the surfers ride the waves that reach the shore here. Unfortunately for me we had to go back along the trail to where we had parked the minibus, as Jorge was on fireman duties that day. Still, it did not seem to take as long to do as the outward walk - probably because of my continued state of wellbeing !
So it came as no surprise that ""Discover Experience"" cover activities such as canyoning, kayaking, canoeing, climbing, boat trips and island touring. You cannot wish for better local guides and their love of their island is palpable in the way they talk about it. They are obviously known by the locals if the number of friendly waves their minibus attracted is anything to go by. The good thing about them is that they tailor your experience with them to what you can do, rather than what you think you can do. As Jorge said to me, ""That way you limit the chances of unforeseen accidents occurring"". After finishing my walk with him,I was absolutely knackered but I was riding high on the adrenalin rush of completing the walk for days afterwards !!","Top Class Guides for Challenging Sao Jorge.","2021-10",,"en","false","2021-10-03T11:46:29-04:00","5","Captivating moments not to describe in words You have to feel it like meeting Serafin Brasil and his wife and dog her eyes moved me intensively.

He is extremely knowledgeable and our experiences (yes plural-3 full day tours and an evening thermal pool experience) were all so incredible, informative, fun and relaxing!  
We would recommend Eleuterio 1000 times over.   Eleuterio’s knowledge of the island, history, sites and his stories were just simply amazing, interesting and so full of energy!  We spent 3 entire days and an evening leaning about “his island” and all it has to offer!  It was especially fabulous for us since my husband was born here but hasn’t been back since he left the island at 4 years old 50 years ago!  It was a different (equally amazing) experience for each of us - my husband coming back to an island he has vague memories of and the rest of us seeing it through his eyes for the first time.  Amazing!  We left our last tour today wishing we had even more time with him!  He makes the tours personal, adds little surprises to the end of some of them, and you can tell his passion is true and heartfelt!  He is fun and so laid back - at the end of each day we couldn’t believe we were out for an entire day and never looked at the time while we were out!
If you are going to Ponta Delgada, Azores - you really must book with him (and we recommend multiple days)!","Amazing!","2022-06",,"en","false","2022-05-25T02:07:54-04:00","5","Had a three day island tour with Eleutério and we absolutely loved every single aspect of it. He was exceptionally knowledgeable and really knew how to organize the itinerary around the constantly changing weather patterns and limited time we did have to ensure we maximized everything we saw. Could not have been more delighted to have chosen him for our tour guide during our visit.

The only drawback is, of course, that we wish we had even more time in the Azores. There's so much to see that three days is honestly not enough (even just for Sao Miguel).

His vehicle seats six (or more?) therefore you can have an entire family in there as well. Kid friendly and elderly accommodating for those with somewhat limited mobility.","Three Day Island Tour","2022-05",,"en","false","2020-11-05T04:02:07-05:00","5","During my stay on Sao Miguel Island I did a full day tour & walk with Azores4Travel and it was the best day tour & nicest hike I did on the island. Eleutério showed us the North East side of the island, we did an amazing hike ´Ribeira do Faial da Terra´ through forests and with some waterfalls and we also had time to enjoy the thermal pools in Furnas on the way back. 

What I really like about Azores4Travel is the very personal service and flexibility. Eleutério knows his home island very well and gives a professional service as a guide with interesting facts and recommendations about the island,  but at the same time is very personal and you can sense his own passion for the island, nature and hiking. This gave me a completely different experience than the ´standard tours´, where guides are ´just doing their jobs´.

In my opinion, this tour was really the best! You feel as a friend rather than a customer and if you like to do something different than the usual,  Eleutério knows all the ´off the beaten track´ secrets for amazing hiking around the island. In addition, they also do ´the standard tours´, so I can really recommend to book all your tours with this company for a more than complete Sao Miguel experience! 

Highly recommended and I hope to be back one day.","The best!

There is a reason that this company is highly rated. Our guide was excellent, the vehicle very comfortable and the island is rich in history and scenery.  The lunch of stew, the famous Furnas Cozido was excellent.  All in all great value for the money, and for those concerned with getting bak to the ship on time, our guide had us at the dock exactly one minute before the time he predicted he would get us back and with ample time to still do some looking around the shops near the port.  I highly recommend this company.","Fantastic Tour of a Beautiful Island","2019-11",,"en","false","2019-10-22T16:21:04-04:00","5","We arranged a 2 day tour of Sao Miguel. All of us were so pleased and impressed with the entire experience with Azores4Travel. We toured parts of the island I'm sure were not on your every day tour.  Cannot wait to visit again and will absolutely use this service.","Wonderful Guide!","2019-06",,"en","false","2019-05-24T05:32:56-04:00","5","We loved our brief but memorable visit to the Azores, all thanks to our excellent guide, Eleuterio.   Because of the weather he suggested we adjust our tour to experience the hot springs, which we're so glad we did - they were amazing!!  And after learning more about the island's thermal activity, we got to visit a tea plantation - which was really very interesting.  We also enjoyed some beautiful in-land and coastal views along the way, as well as learned so much from his enthusiastic explanations of his beautiful island.
Eleuterio gave us an excellent recommendation for lunch at Restaurante Gastronomo and even asked his wife to make a booking for us.  That just perfectly topped off our half day tour!  

We highly recommend Azores4travel and can't wait until we can book another tour one day soon - we hope!!","Fantastic experience!","2019-05",,"en","false","2019-04-29T17:00:32-04:00","5","We had a wonderpil Night with Some experiences we Will never forget. With 8 guest we were guided by Eleuterio, a Local guide with a exceptioneel knowledge of huis lovend island.
First we were guided through the hot water springs, a place where our food was prepared that day (cooked in the ground for 6 hours). After that we had an amazing dinner at the restaurant in Furnas. Really great.
After dinner we went to a hot water spring. A true experience.
And, if it was not enough, Eleuterio guided us to a place with different hot springs and hot & cold water. I wasn’t await about the differences of tasts of water!

Don’t hesitate to contact Eleuterio, but aboth all, go on tour.

Eleuterio is very knowledgeable about his island. He explained the geography, geology and history about the Azores.

We gladly recommend him!","Thumbs Up😀","2019-04",,"en","false","2018-12-16T02:45:17-05:00","5","Eleutério gave us one of the best days we've ever had. It wasn't just a tour, he got to know us, saw what we enjoyed and adjusted each step to give us an absolutely incredible day. 

It does help when you live on an island that has beauty everwhere you look, of course. I can't believe what we saw was all in one place, it was like visiting 3 continents. 

My wife and I never do tours, we always try to do things ourselves but this would have been a huge mistake. Eleutério's local knowledge was what made the day. You absolutely need a guide and I'm sure Eleutério must be the best there is. 

We'll never forget it!","An incredible tour","2018-12",,"en","false","2018-11-30T06:59:20-05:00","5","Our group of 7 visited Sao Miguel in October.  All agreed that not renting a car and using Azores4travel to tour the island for 3 days, as well as take us to and from the airport, was the BEST decision we made!  (Three days touring and two days walking was perfect!)

Eleuterio was a fantastic guide:  personable, super-knowledgeable, and attentive to our preferences.  He used his vast knowledge of the Azores (and local weather!) to plan 3 amazing days of hiking, touring, and eating.  We also appreciated the information he shared with us around culture and the history of the area.  

We could not have seen, done nor learned so much on our own.  All 7 of us would recomend Azores4travel and will certainly call Eleuterio next time we visit Sao Miguel.","Sao Miguel in 3 Days!  Fantastic!","2018-10",,"en","false","2018-11-18T09:04:05-05:00","5","Eleuterio provided a terrific island tour for us in late October 2018.  We (two couples) were traveling on a cruise ship and had a one day stop in Sao Miguel.  It was easy to set up the tour with him via email.   Eleuterio picked us dockside (late model, comfortable van) and took us through the center and western side of the island.  We let him decide were to take us, and he did a great job showing us the countryside.  Lots of lakes, volcanoes, lovely farmland, and dramatic vistas.  We went on a short lakeside hike and had a delicious snack (cheese, bread and wine) at a small local restaurant.   We found him to be an excellent tour guide who enjoys showing his home to visitors.  Highly recommend Eleuterio and Azores4travel.","Excellent Island Tour from Cruise Ship","2018-10",,"en","false","2018-11-10T18:59:32-05:00","5","We booked Eleuterio for a full day of touring and exploring the island, he was fantastic.

We were so fortunate to be able to spend three full days with him during our week away.  He is personable, knowledgeable, professional and attentive.  He was so adept at planning and organizing our outings based on our own interests combined with his vast knowledge of the island, experience with visitors, weather conditions etc.......He took us to stunning vista look-outs, scenic hikes, thermal hot springs, island highlights and historic and charming towns.  As well, he made wonderful restaurant suggestions where we experienced delicious local cuisine.  We happily didn't rent a car and spent our two off days exploring  Ponta Delgada, local beaches  and our lovely neighbourhood of Sao Roque.

They were very organised and professional in keeping me informed about the trips and even phoned me when I was in the UK to check a couple of things. The trips were fantastic and we had great guides, Rui in particular was great fun and we had lots of laughs whilst seeing some beautiful parts of the Island. They were even the same company who provided my travel to and from the airport, everything ran seamlessly, the drivers arrived on time and were lovely and friendly.

Eleuterio drove us all over the island in his van and saw so much for only one day. We got great views of both Sete Cidades and Lagoa de Fogo. He has an immense amount of knowledge about the island which he explained in a clear, interesting way. He took us to both the popular viewpoints as well as some more secluded spots which were just as memorable.

I can't possibly imagine a better guide. I chose Eleuterio because of raving reviews hoping that at least some of them were realistic. The reality by far exceeded our expectations. His great qualities, attentivness, infectious passion for the island, flexibility, professionalism, genuine desire to make you fall in love with this marvelous island on your terms, worked a miracle on us. He managed to taylor this introductory tour on the go based on our initial requests and continuous feedback, so that we didn't feel drained (after the sleeples night on the plane), bored or overwhelmed. We wanted to have an active, outdoorsy trip and see all the highlights. We biked and hiked beautiful trails with our comfort level, swam in the hot springs/ocean swimming hole, dipped in a magical waterfall, enjoyed all major island nature sites, accompanied by impressively knowledgeable commentary, had a delicious meal, experienced the city historic center and were delivered back to the airport right in time.

My brain was overflowing with information by the end of the day. We got to experience the hot springs of Furnas, which were amazing. He also took us to Nordeste, where we learned a lot of history and enjoyed nature. There were a lot of stops in between. Then we expressed interest in swimming so we ended our day with a swim at the surf beach which i cannot remember the name of. All I remember was how much fun it was with the crazy rough waves, misty beach and a lot of surfers. While I was swimming, I saw a horse on top of a cliff along the beach about 20 meters away, which blew my mind!

Did the hot springs and had a great table at a beachside restaurant (with Eleutério's help). Saw the sights from several perspectives, not just a single lookout. Eleutério shared the geology, history, plantlife, animals, etc. of the island throughout the day. He is truly passionate about the Azores and being Portugese.

Andy’s local and historical knowledge of the island made it educational. And, most important, his knowledge of the weather and best time to hit different spots, so you get a clear view without a thousand other tourists, made the experience worthy of 10 stars. He and his team were prompt with communication around booking. His car was immaculate. He listened to our interests and gave us an experience that considered our feedback and wishes.

Andy was a great guide and explained the history behind the sites and was such a beneficial guide.

I would highly recommend Andy’s company and everyone I know will be referred to him while visiting the Azores.

Absolutely fantastic company to work with.","Unquestionably the Azores Best!!!","2022-10",,"en","false","2022-09-05T04:45:09-04:00","5","We LOVED working with Andy and Azores connections. We reached out to Andy for help planning our 2-week honeymoon and he created the perfect itinerary, filled with adventure, relaxation, and beauty. And to our pleasant surprise, while on Sao Miguel, Andy himself was our amazing tour guide!

This was a 10/10 experience, carefully crafted by Andy. From the small details to the big, we felt taken care of by Azores Connections.","Azores Connections helps plan your trip with care","2022-06",,"en","false","2022-08-29T08:09:36-04:00","5","We have just returned from a two-week holiday on Sao Miguel Island in the Azores.  It has to go down as one of the best holidays we have ever had and that is largely down to Andy of Azores Connections.  Due to COVID, we had wanted to put a package together so that we felt more protected if we couldn’t go. We tried several agencies but Andy was the only person who offered to put a fully bespoke package together for us.  This was a family trip for us with our two extremely active 22-year-old daughters so we knew that we needed to keep them fully occupied or they would get bored.  We are definitely not a ‘sit on the beach’ type of family! Andy organised a variety of trips for us and he personally took us on three full-day excursions (the Logoa do Fogo Tour, Furnas Lake, Botanical Gardens and Hot Springs Tour and Sete Cidades Tour) and arranged Coast to Coast Quad Biking, Be a Marine Biologist for a Day, Swimming with Dolphins, Horse Riding and Canyoning trips through his partner contacts.  The whole holiday was superb and hassle-free.  Andy arranged for us to stay at the 4* Hotel Marina Atlantico which we used as our base for the whole trip which suited us well.  On the day trips with Andy, we found him extremely friendly, knowledgeable and fun to be with.  Although we had to get to certain places at specific times, we never felt rushed but, likewise, we never felt like he was having to fill time.  He took us to some amazing view points which we would not have found without him, gave us the opportunity to walk part way around a couple of craters (dropping us off at one point and picking us up at another), waited patiently while we bathed in the thermal pools at Caldheira Velha and the Terra Nostra Botanical Gardens and while we went paddling in kayaks and on stand-up paddle boards on the stunningly beautiful green and blue lakes at Sete Cidades.  He also took photos for us when we couldn’t.  He guided us through the bubbling caldeiras at Furnas and showed us where our Cozido lunch (a stew of mixed meats and vegetables) was being cooked using the heat from the volcano.  During our tours with him, he took us to the Gorreana Tea Plantation and a pineapple plantation which were very interesting.  He also organised car hire for us so that we could explore some of the island on our own.  This proved invaluable as he was able to secure the standard rate.  Others trying to hire a car at the last minute were having to pay 5 times more than we did a day.  We also discovered that booking activities at the last minute was pretty much impossible.  Andy had pre-booked all of ours which ensured we were able to do everything we wanted – and more.  Highlights have to be the canyoning, when we jumped off 7 jumps into the river, varying from 3m-9m, and rappelled down waterfalls, putting us out of our comfort zone and making us overcome our fears. The swimming with dolphins was absolutely amazing.  We swam four times and we saw and heard the large pod of dolphins swimming below us.  We even got to see a small hammerhead shark which was really exciting.  The island is beautiful, lush and green with flowers everywhere.  Overall, Andy helped to organise a fantastic trip that we will remember fondly for the rest of our lives and we would highly recommend using Azores Connections to anyone thinking of holidaying in the Azores. We would certainly go back to them if we were to return.","Fabulous holiday.

The islands are absolutely beautiful, and the people are very friendly.
Andy at Azores Connections organised our entire week in The Azores, booking the hotel and transfers from the airport & fun-filled activities for every day.  He even hosted us for two of our day trips.  He provided a comprehensive online itinerary of everything that we were doing, where to go and when and it all ran like clockwork.
We went whale watching, swimming with dolphins, quad biking, half day canyoning, full day Sete Cidades tour and half day Lagoa do Fogo tour (both with Andy), and Furnas tour with canoeing and hot springs and lunch cooked by volcano.  Every tour lived up to expectations, although the quad biking was more on road than I was expecting.  Andy really knows his stuff and tours with him were relaxed and informative, and his enthusiasm from the islands really comes across.  His chosen partners for our other trips were also great and my personal highlight was seeing a curious Sei whale up close.
If you do go quad biking, or swimming in the hot springs at the botanical garden on the Furnas tour, wear old clothes/old swimming costume.  The iron oxide in the dust/water is an absolute pain to remove.  Eventually got most of it out with white vinegar and lemon juice, but it took ages.","Fantastic holiday organised by Azores Connections","2022-08",,"en","false","2022-08-17T10:51:22-04:00","5","Just back from a delightful tour around the sete cidades.

Andy, from Azores Connections was our driver/tour guide for 3 full days.Our first day, Andy took us to  a volcanic hot springs where we took a dip.  We saw several waterfalls and then to a tea plantation.  We had lunch overlooking the ocean at a sweet restaurant.   The sites were stunning as there are Hydrangeas and Agapanthus growing wild everywhere.The second day Andy took us to Sete Cidades(Seven Cities), stopping along the way.  We saw one of the 7 wonders 0f Portugal, a volcanic complex, which included blue and green lakes, one of the most visited locations of the Azores.We had a great lunch on the banks of the blue lake, which was quite delightful. The third day we  were off to explore the volcanic region of Furnas in the center park of Sao Miguel Island.We took a walk around Furnas Lake and ended up at the bubbling fumaroles which are used to cook meat and vegetable stew.  Then off to Terra Nostradamus Gardens and Hot Springs where we took a dip in the volcanically heated pool of minerals, mostly iron. Then off to Tony's where we ate our stew that had been cooked underground for 6 to 8 hours.  It was amazing.They call the stew Cozido. I tell you all of this in this review, but can't express the credit that goes to Andy our guide.  All of this was experienced with Andy's superb knowledge and expertise of the island and region.  His detailed narrative of each and every place we stopped left you knowing exactly where you were and what you had seen.  He didn't leave anything to wonder, every word was backed by his love for the island that he has lived on for 8 years, where he has learned the language of the Portuguese fluently.We all walked away with a strong  sense and knowledge of the Portuguese people, their love for their island and all its many resources.  We loved our Sao Miguel experience.  We loved Andy as our tour guide and everything he did for us to give us the ultimate experience.  We recommend Azores Connections highly.  We will be back Andy.

First, he planned out an itinerary that worked for a group ranging in age from 6 to almost 60.  This was accomplished with only a broad list of things that we saw online, and a list of our interests.   We were all happy with his original plan, and moved forward with that.  
Then, COVID times hit and Andy gallantly rescheduled our itinerary three times due to flight/arrival changes.  From our end, it looked easy, but I am sure coordinating multiple vendors for schedule changes was no easy feat.  He did all this with a ""no worries"" attitude.
Everything after arrival went smoothly, all vendors picked us up as scheduled, all activities were well organized.  We even spent two days with Andy as our guide.  He was quite informative, allowing us flexibility in our schedule, answering all our questions, and providing much information on the island.  He was also quickly available during our stay for all questions.
Activities planned included: gin tasting, canyoning, scuba diving, snorkeling with dolphins, hot springs visits, tea plantation visit, lunches, kayaking, horseback riding, and visits to see natural beauty.  
All in all, I will recommend Andy to everyone.

I was a little apprehensive about booking through a company, as I usually like to research and plan everything myself, however, this wasn't possible this trip. That turned out to be a great thing though, as I really couldn't have hoped for anyone better than Andy and Laura to take the reins for us!

Communication with Laura during the planning stages was excellent, and she organised a wonderful bespoke package for us, combining some of their more luxurious hotels, lots of activities, and plenty of time to relax too. She responded to all our messages and questions promptly and professionally to make sure our trip was just as we wanted it to be.

Laura also picked us up from Ponta Delgada when we arrived late at night, and it was like being greeted by an old friend. This continued on both our excursions with Andy. They really did well at putting 2 quite shy, reserved travellers like us at ease...even though we responded to all the beautiful things Andy showed us with ""ooh, this is quite nice."" (We promise when we return we'll have learnt a few new adjectives, Andy!)

It's clear how much pride Andy and Laura take in ensuring that people's trips go to plan, and even that their expectations are exceeded, with tour partners and hotels being carefully chosen to ensure a premium experience. They clearly know Sao Miguel inside out and love where they live, and this definitely comes across on the excursions that they lead themselves. We will definitely be returning to the Azores to explore some of the other islands, and we will be asking Andy and Laura for their help when we do. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend their services to anyone planning a trip!","Wonderful, personalised service from Azores Connections!","2019-09",,"42","Tours","61","Outdoor Activities",,,,,,,"#24 of 333 Outdoor Activities in Azores","235","Private Tours","211","4WD, ATV & Off-Road Tours","273","Canyoning & Rappelling Tours","220","Nature & Wildlife Tours",,,,,,,,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/animal-welfare-education-portal/","Learn more","Click below for expert advice on animal welfare in tourism.","This attraction features animals","Features Animals","OPERATOR","<span class=""highlight"">Tours from Azores Connections tend to sell out</span> - travelers recommend booking in advance!","Atlantic/Azores",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189135-d9776021-Reviews-Azores_Connections-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html","http://www.azoresconnections.co.uk","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189135-d9776021-Azores_Connections-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html"

When we arrived at Pico, we had a tour booked to hike down into the volcano caldera. When the day came, the weather was very bad, windy and raining. When our tour guide, Louis, arrived at our hotel for the hike, he informed us that we would not be able to do the caldera hike today due to the weather and the other days when we would be at Pico were already booked up. He was probably wondering if we would just give up for the day due to the weather, but he did suggest an alternative hike, the Praia do Norte coastal hike in Faja. This was an amazing half day hike with beautiful scenery at almost every turn. It had everything: rain forest, cliffs, waterfalls, lava fields, ruins, and beautiful coastal vistas. Louis made this a great day despite the weather. He even found some fortified refreshment along the way. Thank you Louis and Our Island for the great day.","Great scenery, great guide","2022-03",,"en","false","2021-09-05T03:28:41-04:00","5","We had a one day trip to pico.

Our guide, Luis, explained a lot of things about the island (nature, volcanic formations, culture ...) and during the hiking he gave us some practical tips! Totally recommended experiences, if we return to Faial and Pico we will surely contact them again!","Amazing hiking with Our Island!","2021-08",,"en","false","2021-08-18T05:33:06-04:00","5","We loved our day hiking with Our Island’s guide, Luis! We stayed in Pico for 3 full days and were totally in love with the island in general. After spending a day hiking Mt. Pico, we love it even more. 

From the moment I contacted Our Island via email (several months in advance), I knew we were in good hands. I found Our Island through an online magazine article singing their praises and immediately sent Rita at Our Island an email with our details.

A little bit about us: We are a family of 3 (mom, dad, 14-yo-son) who loves hiking. We’ve spent many vacations hiking +/- 3,000 foot ascents/descents through shale, scree & our fair share of bouldering so we felt prepared to do the Pico Mountain Hike. Before I did any research on the topic, I assumed we could do the hike without a guide, as we spend most of our summers trekking and hiking using online guides and maps, alltrails.com, etc. But after some consideration (and reading other reviews of the hike), we decided we definitely needed a guide. And I AM SO GLAD THAT WE DID. I completely recommend Our Island.

Luis was excellent at getting us to the mountain, through the registration process, starting our trek before the crowds, and at finding the most appropriate and environmentally respectful path up to the absolute peak. As we made our way up the mountain, we saw many places where the natural vegetation has been trampled and turned into mud because of trekkers getting off course. Luis showed us ways to hike that preserved and protected the natural fauna.

In order for amazing places like Pico Mountain to remain natural, beautiful and protected, it is essential for travelers to mindfully hike. Without a guide, tourists can truly damage the mountain without even realizing it. It is Our Island’s mission to protect these beautiful destinations.

Luis was also a pleasure to spend the day with. He was a great conversationalist, had so much to tell us about the history of Pico, his personal connection to the island, his work as a filmmaker and his goal to preserve the gorgeous environment of the Azores. 

By the end of the day we were truly exhausted (the hike down is much harder than the climb up!) but we were buzzing with energy. We reached the awe-inspiring vista and were able to see marshmallow clouds, neighboring islands and so much green. It’s one of the best family excursions we’ve had.","Amazing Hiking Guide to top of Mount Pico","2021-07",,"en","false","2021-08-13T16:21:31-04:00","5","We had a private full-day tour of Faial with Pedro from Our Island and had a fantastic experience!

Manuel replied to my e-mails in a prompt and professional manner. He was also instrumental in arranging for Ricardo to be our tour guide for seven days.
Having previously been a client of Amazing Tours, we specifically requested Ricardo to be our tour guide due to his professionalism and historical knowledge of the island, not only we were able to see the more popular attractions but he was also able to show us by special booking equally wonderful places off the beaten track.
Sao Miguel-Azores is a beautiful island and we were able to see many breathtaking views.

Our guide,Jose, was AMAZING.  He welcomed us like family.  Since we had eight family members, we had a private tour with Jose.  

Our tour of Sao Miguel, which included tours #5 and #6, was something to treasure because Jose provided many historical facts, background stories and interesting tidbits of information on almost every landmark, site and village we passed along. Sao Miguel is a beautiful island.

Jose became part of our family over the two days we spent with him.  He went above and beyond to make our trip memorable.  He was able to fit in a stop to the village where my grandparents were born.  He helped to find a local landmark that was very special for my father.  This was the highlight the trip for my parents (and the rest of my family to witness how happy my parents were).  

Getting around for my parents can be challenging sometimes. Jose was so kind to help them in and out of the van.  He made sure that every stop was as accessible as possible for my parents.

Jose - Thank you!

If you are going to the Azores make sure to book a tour with Amazing Tours.","Amazing Two Days","2019-09",,"en","false","2019-07-28T07:58:21-04:00","5","My family and I traveled to the beautiful island of São Miguel for 10 days. We began our experience with Amazing Tours by having our wonderful Tour Guide Joe pick us up at the airport. Even with the many delayed  flight times with our travel Joe made us feel very welcomed to be on this beautiful island right from the start. Our days of touring the island began the next morning and continued for additional 5 more days. Joe left us speechless each and everyday when showing us the different beauties of the island. Joe is a very educated, kind-hearted and wonderful man who even helped with the stress of finding the best restaurants for my family and I to enjoy in the city of Ponta Delgada. Joe even brought us to great lunch places as well as coffee/pastry shops each day. Joe even stayed with our 14 month old daughter in the van to not interrupt her nap schedule, what tour guide would do that? Joe really has been adopted into our family because that is how he made us feel and that is what makes AMAZING TOURS so great to use for your trip to the island. Joe we will miss you very much but won’t make our time away too long so goodbye for now! 

Here are some pictures of my daughter with Joe who she loved so much that she even cried when saying goodbye to him at the airport. Joe even shared his lunch with our daughter as well!

Her narration and knowledge of what we were seeing on Sao Miguel was second to none.  Paula's concern for her clients' needs was paramount with her.  Any number of times, when she couldn't park close to what we were going to see, she let us out, parked the van, and finally returned with it to get us when we were ready to leave.  This was extremely helpful since my wife was still recovering from a broken foot.  She never hurried us, making us feel that we had to adhere to a particular schedule.

My friend and I had a twelve hour layover (which became sixteen with flight delays), and decided to book a tour. If we had just went to Santa Maria’s downtown, we would have assumed that there was nothing to do at all. Henrique showed us differently. He is well versed in the island’s history, topography, geology, flora and fauna. This is not some guy being paid by a company to regurgitate a script, you feel his love for the island, and his Land Rover’s ability off road takes you places you would not be able to access. Even if I were staying in the island with my own car, I would first spend the day with Henrique to have your eyes opened about what you are seeing and what is available to do on the island. 

Booking a Bootla excursion is a win win.

He added a but of zip lining at the end which was very fun. Highly recommend a 1/2 day tour when on the island. We went with 2 teenagers (18 and 15).

Got picked up at the hotel by Henrique (guide & Owner) and the day was just amazing! He took us all around the island, explained everything, stopped at several places and just knew exactly what he was doing & saying and you could feel that he enjoyed what he did and knew what he was talking about. We stopped for a coffee and got given typical biscuits and then we also stopped for lunch which was included in the tour.

First off, he knows his stuff!  Henrique is not originally from Santa Maria, but he has been guiding tours there for many years, and it shows.  He explained the origins of the island, how it was discovered, and how the various towns came to be.  His real passion, however is the natural beauty and biology of the island.  During the tour, he named every single flower, tree, and animal by its scientific name and told us how it arrived on Santa Maria.

Beyond his vast knowledge, Henrique is simply a cool guy.  He spent all day with just the two of us, so we got to know him pretty well.  At the end of the tour, he drove us to the port to catch our ferry back to Sao Miguel.  I gave him a tip for being an awesome tour guide.  He immediately decided to use that tip to buy beers for us, since we had time to kill before our ferry departed!  He hung out with us for a while longer, sipping beers and talking about life… what a guy!

We spent the day driving all over the island.  The tour started in the main town of Vila do Porto, passed by the former US Air Force Base, and proceeded through each town.  We traveled along fence-lined gravel roads, muddy jungle paths, and cut through the side of a mountain.  This tour is absolutely perfect for people with a short visit to the island.  We got to see the entire island, including parts WAY off the beaten path.  Santa Maria has a lot of biodiversity, due to its formation from multiple volcanic eruptions.  We learned all about the history of the island, its various ecosystems, and its culture from our incredible guide, Henrique.","Awesome Day on the Jeep Safari with Henrique!!","2018-09",,"en","false","2018-09-17T07:08:37-04:00","5","We arranged for a full-day Jeep tour of Santa Maria Island and had an excellent experience.

My pickup and return was as promised and the day’s activities were priceless! The full day will give you insights into the entire island, the city, the country side, the food, and shopping. (As an aside, I suggest shopping out of the city to assist the economy of the locals as I feel the quality is better.) Although a full day, I guarantee you will not be bored or get tired! A full course lunch (you will be asked if you want fish of the day, seafood stew, octopus stew or steak in addition to beverages and dessert; I used “stew” because that’s what where I’m from would say) is included served at an open air ocean side restaurant.

He is very gentle and flexible and he is available to personalize your tour a bit according to your needs. We were so lucky to take part to a sort of Local and traditional event called ""Sopa do imperio"", where we tasted local boiled meat for free in a very peculiar event.  It doesn't take place very often, but we were lucky and Henrique explained us everything also about this interesting tradition.

Bruno picked me up in an incredibly clean van at my accommodation which made it easier for me. In the tour around Sete Cidades we visited the best lookouts and stopped at several lakes and locations with a great view. Since it was just me in the tour we stayed as long as I wanted in each place which I really enjoyed. I also went on the tour around Lagoa do Fogo we also and had fantastic views from the different lookouts. Since it was a Sunday and some locations were closed we went to other places instead, such as the Gorreana tea factory, which was a great experience. Bruno also gave me good advice on places to visit in Ponta Delgada and was great to have as a tour guide.

I chose to visit the Terra Nostra Gardens - absolutely beautiful and I was mesmerised by the thermal activity we saw. 
I have reduced mobility so was worried about how I would manage but I needn't have been. Bruno made sure everything worked out well for me.

It was totally an unforgettable experience. As the name of company suggests, the tour included several stops that really make you enter ‘Intothewildazores’! Bruno is an exceptional guide, he not only has the vast knowledge about Azores and its history, but he also makes you feel comfortable within first few minutes of the tour and at the end of the day, he will be remembered as a good old friend:)

There are couple things that make his tour stand out amongst others:
1) As mentioned before, Bruno is a very kind and friendly guide with in-depth knowledge about Azores.
2) The tour included very nice lunch buffet at a restaurant that had a lot of vegetarian options. I have to mention this as it can be difficult to find restaurants with vegetarian options. 
3) Bruno gives a lot of time at each spot so you don’t feel rushed and can soak in the beauty of nature around you as much as you want. 
4) Bruno also trained me on how to take panoramic pictures. I have been traveling past few years and taking lots of pictures everywhere but I never thought about using panoramic option until Bruno pointed out that some of the spots will be better with panoramic views. And he didn’t give up on me until I got it okay on 4th or 5th attempt!

If you are in Sao Miguel island, don’t miss out a tour with Bruno as he will truly make it a special unforgettable day for you!

Felt like reunion with the old friend so the conversation was smooth all trip long. We saw the best spots ever and you can tell Bruno was amazed by the views too. Throughout our trip we had Portuguese course (I think it should be extra charged :P), we can now name few animals, ask for help, tell people that we're here to find a husband plus few other ridiculous things. It was awesome! For lunch we went to some small restaurant serving buffet and food was phenomenal! Go for octopus and chocolate mousse- we can't stop talking about them! We were offered a local drink- passion-fruit lemonade and my friend loved it so much that she was drinking it til our last day. 

It was also great to see how his trips got so popular during the past year. Good luck and see you soon! ;)

Bruno was very pleasant and knowledgeable, tailoring our tours to ensure we saw everything we had researched and requested to see during our trip, going over the advertised time period at no extra cost. 

We would highly recommend Into The Wild Azores Tours while visiting the beautiful island of Sao Miguel and thank Bruno for our incredibly enjoyable adventures.

Our itinerary changed and we contacted via email Bruno, the owner to let him know.  He promptly replied and arranged to pick us up as soon as our ship docked on the new date for our tour.  He took us around this beautiful island and described all we saw and answered our many questions.  I wanted to try the furnas baths and he incorporated that in our schedule; we wanted to try the famous stew cooked in the geysers, and we did that.  It ended up being closer to a full day tour by the time he brought us back to the ship.  Bruno was very considerate of our departure time.  I cannot say enough about this young man and his love of the island.  We were very satisfied and highly recommend him .  Just let him know what you want to see and he'll make sure you have a super experience on his beautiful island.","fantastic tour with Into the Wild Azores tours","2018-10",,"42","Tours","61","Outdoor Activities",,,,,,,"#34 of 333 Outdoor Activities in Azores","216","Eco Tours","235","Private Tours","139","Sightseeing Tours","220","Nature & Wildlife Tours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atlantic/Azores",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189135-d12872728-Reviews-Into_The_Wild_Azores_Tours-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html","http://intothewildazorestours.com/","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189135-d12872728-Into_The_Wild_Azores_Tours-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html"

Rui was prompt, professional,competent, delightful, informative--we could go on and on.  His tour was a highlight of our fourteen day cruise from Southampton to Fort Lauderdale.  As a native of the Azores, the pride he has in his country shines through in his conversation about life on Sao Miguel and its history.  Heavy cloud cover greeted us every where we went but that didn't detract from the tour.  We still were able to gain a sense of the northern portion of the island, its history and its people with Rui's excellent tour commentary.

He is friendly, funny, and so incredibly genuine.  No request is too much trouble for him.  He managed to fit in SO many great places and experiences into his itineraries, while never making us feel at all rushed.  Rui knows his island like the back of his hand and is genuinely so excited to share its magic with visitors.   He was on time and easy to reach via WhatsApp.  His car is very nice (he cleans it every day!) and he drives safely.  He was happy to modify our itineraries to better fit our preferences for the trip, such as adding some time to swim at an amazing local beach where the water is warm at low tide due to an underground geothermal source, or adding a stop at the local winery.  He knows the best local restaurants and bakeries.  He managed to always seem to get us to viewpoints when larger tour groups weren't there, which made them even more magical.  He has encyclopedic knowledge of San Miguel and the Azores, from the geothermal and volcanic science to the animals and plants to the changeable weather, history, and cuisine, Rui can answer any question you can come up with.  I'm sure we saw a ton more places (and experienced way less driving stress) with Rui than we ever would have managed on our own.  Perhaps best of all, he's very pleasant to spend time with.  We felt truly like we were being escorted by a new friend.  I would not hesitate to highly recommend Rui's services.  (He runs his own small business, so be patient with emails - if he's out on a tour, he may not reply until a bit later, but he will reply..)","10 stars!  Made our trip AMAZING in every respect!

Rui is a true professional and very knowledgable guide. From his relaxed demeanour to his well thought out itineraries, we felt like we were able to see all the key spots and lookouts on Sao Miguel Island! Rui was able to describe very interesting facts about both key and hidden landmarks and was very accommodating throughout - he even acted as our emergency ATM in a pinch (thanks again Rui!). Having a private tour also allows you to weave through lines and fit in more sights and experiences - worth every penny. 

Rui emphasized that you can also spend extra time in any favourite spots that you like and not be held to a strict agenda, with no pressure from Rui to keep moving - he would adjust the itinerary accordingly. You could modify your itinerary and add/remove stops that didn’t fit what you had in mind. The cherry on top is being chauffeured around in a nice, clean Mercedes.

We will be recommending Rui to friends and family who visit the island.

We dove in both Praia and Angra and we spotted some of the usual stuff but also some cool stuff too, such as a Viper moray, some big stingrays, a few nudis, loads of hermit crabs and spider crabs (night dive).
Ricardo even allowed for an exploration dive as the last one to find the anchor cemetery in Angra's bay.","Great staff, very professional and super cool, nice diving too","2019-06",,"en","false","2019-03-12T04:29:05-04:00","5","The crew will do everything so that you have the best diving experience.

It was between steep stairs and a ladder in grade, with loose volcanic rock in places.   That's where Marco fit in with his great experience.   He kept us on pace and prevented us from burning out on the ascent (you will need even more energy to descend).  He kept us abreast of where we were and what was ahead on the trail and most importantly provided encouragement.

João is also hilarious and had me laughing so hard I almost fell down the mountain. Could we have climbed Pico unguided?

These guys were exactly what I needed. We started the day traveling the island in an UTV and after lunch we went for a jet ski ride. They are very versatile on this last subject. They sure have a jet ski for your taste. There’s this super powerful one and even one for tricks and jumps. Really cool day! Totally worth it!! 

BTW, if you can choose the instructor go for Filipe or Shawn. Filipe is the best in the water ","Awesome!!! Tried almost everything they had to offer!!!

Nous avons fait le buggy avec Diana (West Side off road UTV 3h30), ce fût énorme. Le tour est complet et permet de découvrir l'ouest de l'île en alternant la côte et la montagne (Serra de Santa Barbara), sur des sentiers et chemins peu fréquentés et loin de la foule. On en prend plein la vue. Celà reste sportif parfois, mais les buggy sont bien entretenus et passent partout. Nous avons passé une excellent matinée en compagnie de Diana, qui est très professionnelle et connaît les lieux. Nous avons adoré cette sortie.

Nous avons fait le tour de Jet Ski découverte de l'îlot des chèvres en compagnie de Shawn. Ce fût la aussi grandiose. On se sent en sécurité malgré des bonnes vagues. On adapte la vitesse de nos engins à notre niveau. Sur place, nous profitons d'une baignade agréable au pied des ilets, immortalisée par des photos prises et envoyées par Shawn. Un moment magique la aussi.

L'équipe de Azores Retreat est formidable. Les 2 passionnés Shawn et Diana font tout pour que leur tours soient parfait. Les jours initialement prévus pour faire ces activités se sont révelées capricieux en terme de météo (pluvieux et brumeux pour le buggy et avec une forte houle pour le jet ski). Shawn n'a pas hésité à nous proposé de nouvelles dates avec une météo plus clémente et une mer moins agitée.

Je recommande vivement Azores Retreat qui propose des tours originaux, uniques, inoubliables.","Des tours inoubliables (UTV Tour / Jet Ski sur l'ile des chèvres)","2019-08",,"es","false","2019-08-15T06:52:42-04:00","5","Cogimos las motos en el puerto, nuestro monitor nos explicó muy bien como conducirla, pronto pusimos rumbo a las Islas.

Also would not recommend this trip for families with children.

If you were thinking of visiting the centre of volcano, walking in its crater -- then your dreams would be fulfilled. Ramiro is the excellent guide, who will not allow you to be bored along this adventure -- he is an intelligent person (native), who has alot to tell you about idemic plants and animals not only of the Faial, but of Azores islands in general. It was a pleasure to talk to somebody so close to the island.

Be ready for a medium to high weakness in the legs for the next day after this trip, as well as washing all the closes you were in. :)

I would also advice to visit guide's website (as did we), because it allows you to find out more about this and other trips, as well as you can book a trip there.

Liels paldies to Ramiro,

We did a 4 hour tour with him which was closer to 5 hours.  He is intimate with every detail and beautiful sites.  Tour of volcano site with the interpretation center was breathtaking. It was a perfect way to view the entire island and next time we will hire him for one of his many interesting hikes on the island. His English is perfect and super polite.  We also used him for airport transport.","Trilhos R tour of Faial- fabulous day with Ramiro","2019-04",,"en","false","2018-10-26T08:44:38-04:00","5","Just came back from an awesome 5 hour tour with Ramiro! This has been a great experience. Ramiro was born on the island Faial and knows a lot about it. He truly loves to show it to his guests and he will bring you  to hidden spots and parts of the island that big busses cannot reach. As we were arriving by cruise, he picked us up at the cruise port. Will definitely recommend this tour and book again. His passion for faial is contagious!

Thank a lot for showing us this beautiful island Ramiro!","Awesome!","2018-10",,"en","false","2018-10-08T00:38:21-04:00","5","Ramiro waited for us in the hotel lobby (well on time) and we set off for a great day together. 

His English was excellent and he obviously knew his home island inside-out. He had an intended tour around most of the famous spots on the island in mind, but he also added small favourites of his own that he thought we specifically, would enjoy (hidden eco bee hives and the likes). This was fun and made us feel like special guests to the island.

He seemed a safe driver, also on some of the more steep and windy roads. We felt completely safe in his hands/van. 

He selected a great place for lunch – with a good view and delicious home cooked food where we could try many different platters (including sumptuous desserts)

Ramiro was completely flexible on all aspects of the tour. If we wanted to stop to take a picture – no problem. He even took photos himself that he later shared with us.

We were running quite late of time (as we were having such a good time) but he never stressed us in any way to get back on time. Even though he must have seen all the places a million times, he was still keen on seeing them with us too. 

Our lasting memory of Ramiro and our day together is his polite, un-stressed, flexible and friendly manners – and the way he shared all the treasures of his home island with us. An unforgettable day !!

And the next day we ran into him as he was waiting for some new clients. It was like seeing a good old friend. We hope a lot more people will benefit from his excellent guided tours on the island of Faial. 

Thanks Ramiro !!","What a great day, Ramiro !!","2018-09",,"en","false","2018-09-15T04:52:25-04:00","5","We had a fantastic day on the Faial island. We chose to do a full day tour.
Ramiro was our guide and took us to all places of interest, many of them quite out of reach of most.
We really appreciate his kindness and friendliness. Always attentive to the details that nature sometimes provides, he showed us buzzards (milhafre) flying with rodents in the claws and we also saw a small calf suckling.
We stopped for lunch in a very typical restaurant with excellent food, where we tasted everything.
We still had time to take a dip in the waters near the Capelinhos volcano.
It was a wonderful experience that I recommend to all who want to know Faial in detail and in good company.
Many successes and keep up the good work.

Desde el primer contacto con Ramiro a través de WhatsApp, y la planificación del tour, todo fue perfecto.
 Contestó inmediatamente a mis mensajes y me dio varias opciones para hacer.  
Hizo todo lo posible por acomodar sus horarios a los días que yo iba a estar en Faial para hacer el tour y a pesar de no tener disponibilidad, buscó un horario ya tarde para que no me fuera de Faial sin conocer Caldeira y Levadas, por lo cual le estaré siempre agradecida porque hizo de mi viaje una experiencia única. 
El día del tour, estuvo en el hotel muy puntual. 
Comenzamos a las 3 de la tarde, estaba programado que terminaramos a las 8 y se extendió hasta las 10:30 de la noche!.  Recorrimos Levadas de noche y con linternas! Una.experiencia  inolvidable 
Durante el tour a Caldeiras, nunca me hizo sentir que teníamos que correr para terminar el tour en un tiempo determinado.
 Bajamos y subimos Caldeira con todo el esfuerzo que requiere, pero fue un placer, lo disfruté muchísimo, y se lo debo a la experiencia y la paciencia de Ramiro. 
Es un guía execelente con una gran calidez humana. Ojalá no cambies nunca tu manera de trabajar!

Enquanto procurávamos informações vimos um flyer dos Trilhos R, fomos ao seu site e gostámos muito da informação. Fizemos a nossa reserva e fomos presenteadas com o Ramiro :) Além de muito bonito é extremamente simpático, atencioso e conhecedor da fauna e flora que compõe a sua ilha.
Fizemos um tour de meio dia, onde ficámos a conhecer magníficos locais que só com um guia apaixonado pelo que faz poderíamos conhecer.
Estivemos no Faial por 4 dias e posso dizer que o momento alto da nossa estadia foi a tour que fizemos. 
Para quem quer conhecer a ilha do Faial, com tempo, bom ambiente e dedicação recomendo fortemente o Ramiro.

We spent the day zipping here and there giving us enough time to get out and look around at each stop. Now that we have seen the island if we ever go back we would like to just strictly go to the hot springs/bath and enjoy a meal that has been cooked in the ground.

However, when we met our guide at the appointed time, it turned out that we were to be accompanied by six other people from the ship, total strangers to us, (some quite large) and we were all to be stuffed uncomfortably into a 8-passenger mini-van with limited visibility.  Needless to say, we were not at all happy, and declined to go on the tour.  We could only assume that the company thought we would go on the tour anyway with the other people rather than make alternative arrangements at the last  (they were wrong).  I cannot comment on the quality of the tour, but the management's ""bait and switch"" tactics are a poor reflection on the island's hospitality.

I took up 3 tours with this company (0.5 day Seven Cities lake, 1 full day Fire Lake and Furnas hot springs tour, and 1 full day Nordeste tour), and was able to enjoy pretty much everything I've wanted without any hiccup or trouble.

I was accompanied by Rui for all the tours and he was very central to why it made the these days very enjoyable for me. He's a careful driver who's extremely familiar with the roads in São Miguel, and that made me feel very safe. He also made sure to bring me to all the popular viewpoints AND some lesser known ones along the way only locals like himself knows and it was very appreciated! I managed to snap many, many beautiful photos throughout the tours. And whenever we stopped at viewpoints and attractions, I was never rushed so I had all the time to take pictures until I'm satisfied. Really appreciated this!

All in all, if you're considering a tour of São Miguel, look no further! Azores dreams is the company to go for! I found this company on TripAdvisor here as well, decided to go with them due to their positive reviews from prior customers and had no regrets! I will happily do another tour with them again when I get another chance to visit the beautiful São Miguel Island again in the near future!

João was able to show us the incredible highlights of the island on our two tours and his passion and love for his home was revealed through his descriptions of history and landscape.

For those wishing to learn why, you may want to read a detailed review below.

We are just back aboard our cruise ship after our third and best ever tour with Joao of Azores Dream Tours. On arriving at Punta Delgada our family group of five was disappointed to find heavy low-lying clouds covering the island with landing planes disappearing into the mist.
Already committed to a tour we were happy to meet Joao again but did not expect much in the way of sightseeing.  We asked Joao to use his judgement and make the best of it.

Going back a few years we chose him from a random group of drivers for his friendly manner and good command of idiomatic English.  Turns out he is also comfortable with German, French, Spanish, and of course Portuguese.  We also liked his clean 8-passenger Mercedes van.  That day we saw the beautiful blue and green twin lakes west of Punta Delgada both from the rim of the volcanic crater they lie in and close up from the picnic areas along the shore.  Joao explained why one of the lakes appears green and the other blue. There were no canned spiels, just informal answers to whatever interested us -  weather, botany (he loves the prolific hydrangeas), the economy - whatever.  His took us places we would never have reached in a large tour bus. It was a great tour and we told Joao we hoped to see him again someday.

It turns out that many Transatlantics cruises stop in the Azores so the next time we emailed Joao but explained that we had a larger group this time (over a dozen).  ""Not a problem"", he writes, because his brother Miquel owns the tour company and has many vehicles available. There would be a second van and driver, so we had another great tour which customized to our interests, included a visit to a tea factory and the village of Furnas and its hot springs.
As to this latest tour Joao suggested we head to the north side of the island and head east.  The main roads and infrastructure are remarkably well maintained and we quickly climbed out of the clouds into bright warm sunshine with greenery everywhere and the ocean in the distance.  Our first stop was an overlook on the coast with stunning views in both directions. Continuing past fields with lazy cows, tea plantations and factories, we headed for the hills and finally arrived high on the rim of a huge crater with a stunning view of the Village of Furnas, far below.
Descending to the town, a short drive brought us to the boiling hot springs - bringing to mind a miniature Yellowstone.  Joao then walked us to a factory outlet for flavored liqueurs.  These were so good we had to buy a bottle of the coffee  liqueur which to my taste was superior to the top selling coffee liqueur - also a bargain.
We all got in the van and climbed back over the rim and down to the ship still embedded in the same gloom and a occasional light rain.
So here is a toast to Joao, our favorite driver and friend - with Azores Coffee Liqueur.  We love the beautiful Azores and shall return.
While this might appear to be a ""planted"" endorsement I assure you that we are not related to Joao or Azores Dream Tours in any way and have personally written this review without compensation.","Azores - three exceptional tours","2018-04",,"en","false","2018-04-07T09:57:16-04:00","5","Third time with this company and the product just gets better.

We had an excellent day with him touring the Sete Cidades lakes and the western part of São Miguel. 

We started in a pineapple farm, then climbed to the crater edge. A delicious lunch was in Sete Cidades before working our down to the coast. 

Throughout Paulo was informative with the right amount of information that did not overwhelm us. We were a small party of six people so there was plenty of time to ask questions. Each of the stops had something different and new to learn. There was plenty of time to take photos and to admire the landscape that was stunning. 

Paulo’s driving was careful and as a result I did not feel nauseated on the numerous turns. 

I cannot recommend his tour highly enough and wish him well.","Sete cidades and Western Coast Tour.

This was my 3rd time in the Azores and while each time was amazing, this trip was the best experience due to having Paulo as a guide and seeing places I would not have seen on my own or even another tour company or guide.

One of the reasons I chose Paulo was because of his unique tours, which include hiking and other options like a night time hot springs experience besides of course also being able to see all the other breathtaking sites, like Sete Cidades and Furnas.

As a travel advisor, I always look for unique and off the beaten path experiences for my clients and the days with Paulo were amazing.
We explored Nordeste, probably one of my favorite areas on the island and we did 2 hikes as well as the night time hot springs experience in Furnas.

All tours were customized by Paulo for me and it was such a pleasure to hear stories about the history of the Azores. Paulo really brought it all to life, it was inspiring and fascinating.

One of my favorite experiences was the hike to Lagoa do Fogo, it was absolutely breathtaking and I would love to do it all over again. 

Paulo is caring, respectful and he loves his home, the Azores. 
It was a real pleasure to be with him and experience the island with. I can't imagine having a more wonderful experience than I've had over those few days exploring this beautiful island with him.

I am already planning to come back and do a couple of the van tours and definitely more hikes with him.

I will use Paulo and FUNtastic Azores Tours for all my clients visiting São Miguel and if you are looking for a wonderful tour guide, Paulo is the one. 

Thank you Paulo for the great experience, until we meet again.","Unforgettable experience with an amazing guide in São Miguel","2022-03",,"en","false","2022-03-25T02:29:23-04:00","5","We only had 2 days to discover Sao Miguel but thanks to Paolo we managed to discover many highlights of this beautiful island.

We hope to return sometime and do some tours with him again.

We wanted to tour the island, so we booked two tours with Vera. If you really want to see São Miguel the best way to do so is with a tour! I cannot recommend Vera enough, she is truly a phenomenal tour guide. We'd already done a group tour with Vera in May 2017 that when we returned to the island, we wanted her to be our tour guide again. Vera really tailored our tours to our time and interests. She's professional and knowledgeable, about the history and culture of the island, as well as about the fauna and flora. She's an excellent driver and knows her way about São Miguel like the back of her hand, which makes all the difference. She loves her job and it shows :) Those two days we got to see so much, it was amazing!  One day we toured the western part of the island: Lagoa do Fogo, Lagoa das Sete Cidades, Caldeira Velha and Lagoa de Santiago. The next day we toured the eastern part of the island: Caloura, Vila Franca do Campo, Furnas (caldeiras and lagoa), Cascata da Ribeira dos Caldeirões and the Gorreana tea plantation and factory. She really made the most of the two days we had and I'd love to do a tour with her again in the future :)

PS. It's also worth noting that during these COVID times that Vera has the clean and safe certifications. We practiced social distance and wore mask when in closed spaces. The van was equipped with hand sanitizer and we felt perfectly safe at all times!","Book a tour with Vera to make the most of your time in São Miguel!","2020-08",,"en","false","2020-04-14T05:45:00-04:00","5","Black and white towns, volcanic landscapes, blue and green lagoons, rolling green fields bordered with flowers, and happy cows everywhere.

We were recommended to contact Paulo at Funtastic Adventures for sightseeing.  What Paulo provided was far more!  He met us as soon as we arrived at our accomodations and once we got settled, took is downtown for an amazing dinner where he also made recommendations for wines and food to us.  Daily he would pick us up and help us plan the day.  We told him what we were interested in and he customized it daily according to what part of the island had the best weather and also made suggestions for other activities, all of which were awesome.  We did everything from 8km hikes to vineyard tours, seeing volcano craters, amazing cliffs, black sand/rock beaches, natural hot springs and so much more.  When we were running low on drinks and food at our villa he would take us to the grocery store and help us translate ingredients for dietary requirements for 2 of us. I have travelled for many years and have never had a guide like Paulo.  He was friendly, personable, always on time and never in a hurry.  He was dedicated to a truly exception experience.  I would recommend him to anyone who goes to the Azores and if you have not considered going there, I would say you need to do it!

He was the best tour guide that we've ever had in over 20 years of arranging private tours during land vacations or cruises.

I arranged 4 customized tours for our group of 6 adults with Paulo in advance of our week-long stay on the beautiful island of Sao Miguel in September, 2019. Paulo answered my emails and questions very promptly, which helped in planning the tours to meet our needs and interests. He offers a variety of tours for all ages and interests, which are reasonably priced. Paulo was very dependable and was always on time when picking us up at our hotel. His van was clean and comfortable and he was a very safe driver.

Paulo is a great ambassador for his homeland. He is friendly, flexible, and has a nice sense of humor, which made our time with him very relaxing and enjoyable. Paulo is highly fluent in English and has a master's degree from the local university. He shared a wealth of information about the history, culture, geology, botany, etc. of the Azores, and answered many questions that we asked him about schools, food, customs, restaurant suggestions, etc. I highly recommend FUNtastic Azores Tours and would definitely contact Paulo again if I ever return to Sao Miguel in the future.","Four FUNtastic tours with a fantastic tour guide","2019-09",,"en","false","2019-09-25T09:09:04-04:00","5","We booked the night thermal and dinner activity and had a great time.

Guide Paola picked us up at our Ponta Delgada hotel exactly the on time and we proceeded to pick up two other couples.  As we drove to Furnas he did a great job pointing out some of the interesting sights along the route and answering our questions.  First stop was dinner in a local restaurant with the local volunteers (can’t remember the Portuguese name) which included wine and dessert.  Around 9 we reached the thermal bath and he helped us get oriented before giving us free time to explore the 5 different baths.

While in theory this is something you might be able to do on your own, we were really relaxed and tired after 90 minutes soaking in the steaming water so it was especially great to have a designated driver.

Both guides were locals, knowledgeable, and people I was happy to spend the day with.

The van on the full day Furnas tour was new, very clean and the AC worked great. Tiago juggled the tour in both English and Portugese for a diverse group. The van on our second day was older but still clean, but didn't have AC though the open windows gave more than enough circulation.

I was happy Tiago and Diego were navigating all the curvy roads and I wasn't, drove efficiently but safely. While none of the spots visited were ""hidden gems"" per say, getting dropped off at the viewpoints vs. walking up all the hills from the parking lots was a perk.

Would recommend Pedro's tours for solo travelers or groups, and looking forward to my next visit.","Great option for solo traveler with minimal time","2022-08",,"en","false","2022-07-14T09:37:42-04:00","5","Great experience, Tiago was our guide and he was amazing.

We would be arriving for one day during a Cruise Ship port visit while in port at the beginning of November.  Sergio was very honest with me that the sea conditions in November would not be optimal for fishing and suggested a land tour in one of their Jeeps that would accommodate up to 6 passengers (turns out they are NOT jeeps - which are smaller - but it easily held four of us in the three rows of seats in a Toyota SUV).  
I recontacted him the day before we were to arrive at the island and we arranged a land tour.  While nearly all of the passengers aboard the ship disembarked and got onto big tour buses for their island tour, we were met by Natacha pier side.  It was at that moment when I began to appreciate what we had arranged.    Natacha had a wonderful personality, she spoke flawless english and treated us like we were family from the moment we climbed aboard the SUV.  The experience was memorable for us.  We saw the sights of the island (absolutely beautiful volcanic island) and had lunch in the community at a very popular local restaurant.  Overall, considerably less expensive than the shore excursion fees for a family of four and we were never crowded or uncomfortable.  Natacha tailored our sightseeing stops to insure we were at the sights before or after the giant mobs on the tour buses.  It was very personal and exceptionally comfortable.","Exceptional land tour of Sao Miguel","2019-11",,"en","false","2019-08-27T10:03:00-04:00","5","As our first time big game fishing it was a great experience. Great weather great crew and great food. We saw plenty of dolphin and a few fake orcas (large dolphins) as well as catching 6 tuna. The first tuna caught we thought was huge but when we compared them to the 125kg final fish they were tiny. My 17 year old son who’s had no experience with this kind of fishing was able to fight the 125kg fish so this is doable for novices. Greatly exceeded our expectations and thoroughly enjoyed!

We had a beautiful view of the sunset. We were served wine (flowing freely, if I may add), bread, cheese, and olives. We were invited to swim off the back of the boat and about half of the guests chose to do so. There were nine guests on the boat in total. The staff made sure we were safe and well-cared for.

We chose the sunset catamaran tour that lasts 3.5 hours. The catamaran is small and we were eight guests in total, so it was a very calm and intimate experience. After boarding, safety was put first and the skipper showed us how to walk across the catamaran with safety ropes. Since it was a little cold, we were provided with jackets and blankets and a few times, the crew came by to ask if we had everything we needed and to tell us about special locations or marine life that we were seeing on the way following the east coast. It was perfect to relax and to unwind. After a while, baskets with appetizers (bread, cheese, and olives, as well as water and white wine) were served. We were completely relaxed and enjoyed every moment. Luckily, we had a wonderful sunset and the sea was very calm, so it wasn’t cold at all.

On the first day had some small action, but no fish on the hook. We spotted a Blue Marlin right in front of us, but he did not follow the bates. 

On the second day we spotted a Blue Marlin and this time we where more lucky, it took the bate, but got away. After around 15 minutes there was another Blue Marlin chasing the bates and this time the fish was on the hook. It is amazing how powerful the Blue Marlin is, he just pulled the line out 800 mm within a few minutes. The fish was around 3,7 m long and about 300 kg, to pull it in, was quite an experience. After the fish was next to the boat, it was released. 

On the third day we did not have any luck, no action.

Much better than taking a boat there. You get a decent work out and it’s a much more beautiful way to experience the Islet. We were picked up from the hotel by 2 guides who were very friendly and warm. It was about a 25 minute drive to the marina. I’ve done a lot of kayaking and these tandem kayaks were so comfortable I was surprised. The guides were very patient and also clear with their instructions. It’s an easy-moderate paddle to the isle about 25-30 minutes. The waters are turquoise and it was pretty calm for the sea. We had the option to paddle around the protected reserve and it’s definitely an option you want to take! It’s breathtaking to see the arches and then to kayak in and explore the caves. We then parked our kayaks inside the protected reserve and had a chance to snorkel (lots of fish for such a small area in such shallow water) as we were there at low tide and hike to see the different view points. We spent about 45 minutes there then we paddled back. The whole experience was about 3 hours not including transfer. It’s totally worth the money! Thanks Fun Activities for the great experience!

Paulo was incredibly flexible, empathetic and understanding with the situation and we were greeted by him personally at the airport upon arrival after 10pm. He moved our reservations around to the extent he could so that we could see/do as much as possible with our remaining time. Paulo was kind and patient and made sure that we were able to get a late dinner before dropping us off at a beautiful and spacious hotel in Nordeste. On the ride there he provided us with helpful information about our activities and also about the island. All of our guides were fluent in English, easy going, and on time. We enjoyed their company, especially Daniela's. All three of our accommodations across the island were super clean, provided breakfast and were located within walking distance of attractions and restaurants. We biked (bikes were in excellent condition), hiked and went canyoning with Fun Activities. Our guide for canyoning, Joao, was extremely experienced, confident and very helpful every step of the way. The picnic lunches were in environmentally reusable containers and they also provided reusable silverware.  The lunches were healthy and delicious. We flew to Pico for a few days and upon our return Paulo arranged a driver for us to take us to the pharmacy for our Covid tests. We took the test and he drove us downtown for lunch and then picked us up again to retrieve our test results and then dropped us off at the airport.

Our tour guide was evidently a last minute no-show, so a taxi driver was substituted instead.  A nice man, but unfortunately he spoke little English.  We were so looking to our visit here and learning about Ponta Delgado, especially since we are unlikely to return. But we ended up with a mostly silent taxi ride that did not make all the advertised stops and did not last the advertised six hours.  We learned nothing about the area. And the stop at the 'pineapple plantation' was a joke. To call them 'plantations' is a stretch. It was a look into a greenhouse, then a visit to the gift shop. A couple we met later on our cruise ship evidently visited a different set of pineapple greenhouses where a staff member discussed the process, then showed them a video. They also had fresh pineapples for sale at the other location.  

After the tour ended, we walked on our own to a market where we purchased fresh pineapple for less than 3 euros.  It was delicious!! Definitely try it when you visit this port.","Disappointing tour","2022-10",,"en","false","2022-11-01T07:14:20-04:00","5","We stopped at Ponta Delgado on a transatlantic cruise. Due to an issue with another port, the ship rescheduled. Azores Tours was very accommodating in changing our tour date. 

Our guide and driver, Marco was a hoot. His English was great, and you could tell he really loved his home and all it had to offer. The tour hit the major highlights, and stopped in a little town for lunch and chocolate with amazing views. 

I’d asked to stop so I could buy a specific cheese you can only find there. Marco did me one better by stopping at a cheese store where we got to sample several local cheeses. Everyone on our tour had a great time. I can’t believe some people just walked around the town and missed all the beauty Sao Miguel has to offer. 

We got back to the ship in plenty of time, always a concern with third party tours. 

Bottom line: great guide, lovely tour, and at a great price.","Great place, great tour.","2022-11",,"en","false","2022-09-29T16:45:35-04:00","5","Azorean Tours was a great to use!

Pedro picked us up at the airport on time and took us to the accommodation, and gave us a brief introduction of the tour on the way, which was the great kick start of our Azores trip. 

In the next few days, we spent a really good time with Felipe, one of the team members of Pedro. Felipe was fantastic! He was very professional and knowledge as a tour guide, which was amazing because we get to know Azores in a much more extensive level. Not only were we able to visit all the famous sites and beautiful areas with a nice comfortable jeep, we were able to understand Azores's environment, history, culture and economy, and have a better understand of this beautiful island's past and future.

Apart from being a professional tour guide, we also regarded Felipe as a local friend, who recommended us all the nice local restaurants and places to have fun at night. If you booked with Pedro and is looking for a young and fun guide, we definitely recommend you ask for Felipe!!

In our last day, unfortunately the host of our accommodation has very strict check-out policy and did not give us any option for bag storage for our late flight, luckily Pedro was very kind and allowed us to store our big suitcase in his hostel. This allows us to explore the island freely the last day,

A native of Sao Miguel, our guide for all 3, Filipe, spoke Portuguese, Spanish, and English, and shifted seamlessly from one to the other as we spoke English, and others on the tour spoke Spanish.  He was knowledgeable about the entire island, its history and culture.  Moreover, he was very personable and accommodating, always displaying a terrific sense of humor and a love of his home and traditions.  Bring your cameras because the natural beauty of flowers (hydrangeas,ginger lilies everywhere),amazing vistas of ocean cliffs and volcanic lakes, as well as historic churches and quaint villages offer many photo ops.  Each area of the island is somewhat different, so if you have the time, do it all.  The Furnas tour offers the chance for a dip in the hot springs.  Be aware that you will come out with a coating of mustard colored film, but showers are available and our skin was noticeably softer after our dip.   The tropical gardens are beautiful and, although we had better meals while in Ponta Delgado, it was fun to try the stew (which was similar to our American pot roast) cooked in the thermal water. I would totally recommend this company, especially Filipe, as he was always punctual, cordial, and genuinely happy to share his island with us.","3 great full day tours,","2018-08",,"en","false","2018-08-27T13:41:58-04:00","3","We enjoyed two full day Jeep tours with this company. First day it was Nordeste, the greenest county of Sao Miguel. The route was beautiful and we stopped at several view points. We traveled in a group of four jeeps. Our Jeep was the smaller and older kind . The windows were a bit dirty and some did not open which interfered with taking pictures and adjusting the comfort of the journey. The lunch was very good and it was a part of the trip. Our guide was Louisa - very pleasant and energetic but it seems with a bit less experience than the other guides so she could give us less information and could not answer some questions but referred us at times to her colleagues.
The next day was full day Sete Cedades and it was a beautiful experience again including the good lunch. But we got the same Jeep and the windows still dirty and defective.
In spite of minor deficiencies I would confidently recommend this company as a choice for exploration of the island. Having an experienced knowledgeable guide also helps.
Next time we will perhaps look into their hiking trips.","Two full day trips.","2018-08",,"42","Tours","55","Boat Tours & Water Sports","61","Outdoor Activities",,,,,"#16 of 135 Boat Tours & Water Sports in Azores","211","4WD, ATV & Off-Road Tours","214","Bike Tours","183","Walking Tours","217","Fishing Charters & Tours","139","Sightseeing Tours",,,,,,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/animal-welfare-education-portal/","Learn more","Click below for expert advice on animal welfare in tourism.","This attraction features animals","Features Animals","OPERATOR","<span class=""highlight"">Tours from Acores Trilhos da Natureza tend to sell out</span> - travelers recommend booking in advance!","Atlantic/Azores",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189135-d2716711-Reviews-Acores_Trilhos_da_Natureza-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html","http://www.azorestrailsofnature.com","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189135-d2716711-Acores_Trilhos_da_Natureza-Ponta_Delgada_Sao_Miguel_Azores.html"

As every whale/dolphin company claims but not deliver: these guys really care about the animals. Swimming with dolphin is possible, but only when they see the animals are at ease. Did a great trip on the ocean with them and experienced an unbelievable encounter of 6 spermwhales. Multiple breaches out of the water and up & close meeting the animals, swimming towards us, we got it all. I stuck my camera in the water and got these amazing shots. Oh, I forgot the 100 dolphins playing around our boat..","Wow is the only word that fits","2022-07",,"en","false","2022-07-27T10:58:14-04:00","5","We did several trips over our week in Ponta Delgarda and this was definitely the best one.   If you want to do a whale and dolphin watching trip I would really suggest doing one with Sea Colours.   

We did the whole day trip that is a split of a sailing trip (with Paulo) and time on a rib (with Jasmine).   It was pretty calm on the day we went, so the sailing was a bit slow but it meant that the rib trip was fairly calm.   Obviously seeing anything from a boat under sail is pretty hit or miss (we saw a shy beaked whale from a distance, but not much else) but it was still enjoyable. On the day we went, a small group went sailing first and another group went on the rib first - we then met up at sea and swapped boats.  The advantage was that when we met up with the rib at lunchtime we were able to go straight to the area where Jasmine had seen whales that morning (and be the only boat there for quite a long time).  We saw sperm whales, Atlantic Spotted dolphins, Bottlenose dolphins and lots of playful Risso dolphins, and a couple of shark dorsal fins. While we did a full day trip, I think that the shorter half-day trip that they also do would also be an excellent experience.  

Jasmine was great at being in touch before our visit and we really liked the ethos of the company - these are people who do research about the whales and dolphins, and going with them funds this as it allows them to undertake research on the day of the trip (identifying which individual whales are seen) and provides revenue for their ongoing research. This is different from the other commercial boats.   If you are interested in supporting this work, and want to go on a trip with really lovely knowledgeable people then we would recommend this trip.   When we re-visit the Azores we will book with Sea Colours again and would genuinely recommend them to anyone visiting.  ","Really recommend this trip....","2022-07",,"en","false","2022-07-12T15:49:42-04:00","5","We wanted to see whales in a respectful way and this tour did just that. 
We saw this company mentioned in a guide book, looked at recent reviews and emailed them.
Janice wrote a lengthy and informative reply and arranging the trip was easy. 
Janice gives a little talk at the beginning of the trip on land, you get kitted out with waterproof jacket and trousers and life jacket, dry bags are also available. 
Opportunity to use the bathrooms and off we went. It’s a small RIB and a max of 12 people so not crowded and excellent to be low in the water for great viewing of the wildlife.  Crashing through the waves was great fun as we went out to sea, everyone on the lookout for that first glimpse of whales. We were not disappointed. Around 8-9 sperm whale were lazing around, enjoying a Tues afternoon doing what whales do. We must have spent around an hour or so watching this group; the boat not getting too close, being respectful at all times and not cutting across the path of the whales. Plenty of opportunity to ask questions and take photos. Janice is very informed and you can tell the wildlife is her absolute passion. 
I would recommend this trip without hesitation to see whales   with a company that respects their habitat.","THE whale watching trip you should go on when in Sao Miguel","2022-07",,"en","false","2022-07-02T09:08:29-04:00","5","Sea Colors is the only company you should consider going out with for dolphin / whale watching in Sao Miguel. 
We booked two trips with them because we were coming to the Azores specifically for cetaceans and they did not disappoint. In addition to taking us on two exceptional trips on which we saw sperm whales It’s also clear that this company is more ethical and conscious of the animals than others. We saw other boats drive directly in the path of the animals and sort of chase them down - this was not at all the vibe with Sea colors who were instead careful to give you an amazing view of the animals but also incredibly careful to give the animals space to exhibit their natural behaviours. I hope we come back to The Azores soon and go out with them again.","The best trip in Sao Miguel","2022-07",,"en","false","2022-06-29T14:29:54-04:00","5","The whale watching experience with Sea Colours in Ponta Delgada was an amazing experience.
Sea Colours personnel is highly professional, nice and respectful.
Sea Colours differs from other whale watching services as the personnel is highly motivated and you can feel the passion for the sea and nature they are able to share.
During our whale watching, today almost 9 sperm whales altogether, Sea Colours has always been very respectful of the sailing rules sailing at very low speed near the coast and always respecting the whales keeping the appropriate distance.
Before boarding the rubber boat you are provided with water proof trousers, jacket and bag in addition to the life vest.
Sea Colours does not use big boats with many passengers on board but only rubber boats with a limited number (max12) which is the best way to fully appreciate the experience respecting the whales.
Super recommended.

Once we were all happy with the whales, we went for dolphins which was also incredible. 
With Jasmine instructions, we had the chance to swim with them for a couple of min.

You can clearly tell that Jasmin’s motivation is not about making business, but to give people an understanding of what’s going on in the ocean and how beautiful it is - her passion definitely made me come back (and recommend her to friends visiting the Azores in August). Unlike bigger companies Jasmin and her husband have a speedboat - this way it’s easier to react, the boat can move closer to the animals and generally you are closer to the animals.

We were on our way back to base when they received a radio message that whales had been spotted, almost where we had just come from. They turned around and we went back out to sea.
They found a number of Sperm whales and a Fin whale (2nd largest animal on the planet!).

I have done two tours, each of them absolutely fantastic and unforgettable. 

Reasons for Sea Colors:
1. Respect for the animals: they do they tours with respect to the animals and they shall not be disturbed during the tour
2. intense experience: respect for the animals and having an intense experience is not a conflicting target. I had very good views and various animals
3. Speed Boat: You do the tour with a speed boat. So you are quickly at the animals and the Ride is just fun!
4. Sea Colors Team: The Team of Sea Colors are very nice People and you feel really good with them. Furthermore they are very qualified and motivated - they are really happy to answer all your questions and to shape you a wonderful experience.

I would always do the tour again with Sea Colors. And for sure: when I come back to São Miguel, the tour is a mandatory point on my holiday checklist. 😊

Be sure to take this tour! So much better than all these large vessels with their commercial tours.

This tour takes you on a small RIB out on the ocean up close to the animals with a crew that know everything there is to know about the animals. The pride, passion and joy they show  about the sealife is intoxicating.

We have taken whale- and dolphin watching trips on many locations and lots of companies, but we never have had such an amazing time as with Sea Colors Azores.

So if you love spotting animals up close, put on your swimsuit and book with them. You will not regret it.

The staff at Sea Colors is out there conducting research while you enjoy the views, the marine life, and the interpretation offered by the staff on board who are very knowledgeable and actually respect the wildlife that they encounter. The best example of this is when we saw a whale while there were many other big tourist boats all around also watching the whale. When the whale went under for a good amount of time, the other boats were bored with it, got a radio call to another whale sighting and all rushed away. The staff at Sea Colors knew this type of whale and said that we should stick around, even though all the other boats left, because it would likely come back up. Sure enough, we had a far more spectacular viewing of the whale a few minutes later all by ourselves when it returned. It pays off to book with a good, honest company.

Together with my diving instructor Rodrigo and another buddy, we made two incredible dives. One of which was an wreck dive where we saw octopus and other amazing seacreatures. Rodrigo was very pleasant, took it slow and took care of a very relaxed atmosphere both on the surface and underwater. Other than Rodrigo, the captain of the speedboat took good care of us and the equipment. Both Rodrigo and the captain took pictures of us with (underwater)cameras, which is so special to have.

I'm shocked at how highly rated this place is.

I knew I was coming to the Azores weeks before I wanted to dive so I emailed this company and also called both numbers on their website and also whatsapped the same numbers. Absolute no response even though they were read. When I first arrived in ponta delgada I went straight to the dive shop to find out why no contact and to see when I could dive. The next three days were booked up even though I tried weeks in advance to arrange but like I said I was ignored. I was given no explanation of why I was ignored. I was given a potential date of when I could dive towards the end of my trip and the representative gave me his email and and said email him to confirm (Alberto). Emailed twice and didn't get a response.

Shame on you. Waste of time and space. 

There are more friendly dive shops next door to them FYI.","Ignorant company.

Likely this is the very spot you see in your image search of the Azores. The hike begins very flat up to near the end when there is an incline up to the summit. Very doable for all, a light hike on paved roads to start then gets a bit tougher once you get onto the hill. We used hiking poles and they were a bit helpful for the steeper areas but definitely doable without them. The summit does get cloudy often, and it would be of value to wait 30 minutes and see if the sights improve. There may be some spots to sit to the left of the banister at the top. You may want to consider coming here earlier in the week so you can opt to go a second time if the conditions are not clear at the top.

A tip if you're doing this and the other nearby attractions (the view point to the west, Miradouro da Vista do Rei, and also the Sete Cidades town by the lake) on foot if you are being dropped off by a taxi - there are no hiking routes north or east round the lake from this point (from what we could tell) so you need to walk along the road going west. You can walk by the side of the road in the first half, then the rest is on the road itself - it's wide enough to walk along and we found the road to be fairly quiet, but of course, be cautious all the same.

There are great views along the way but consider a tour or going by car if you are expecting a dedicated trail between these two viewpoints!","Essential - but some advice if you're exploring the lakes on foot","2020-03",,"en","false","2020-01-11T04:06:39-05:00","5","Great view over the craters and lagoons.

If you can't walk very far or are short of time, don't park in the parking lot by the main road. If the gate is open, drive in and follow the dirt road that everyone is hiking along to the very base of the ridge where the trail goes uphill to the actual ""miradouro""/viewpoint. There is room for several cars there. The view is amazing. If you have bad knees, bring trekking poles.

Second, it you get there and it's a bit cloudy, stay awhile and hope the clouds pass.  Or do what we did, drive down to Vista do Rei and when the skies begin to clear, go back to Boca do Inferno.   It's really not that long of a hike to the viewpoint, if you park in the closer parking lot.

This viewpoint is the image that first got me interested in going to the Azores.  It was surreal being there in person!

Make sure you plan enough days on Sao Miguel to get to see Sete Cidades and Lagoa do Fogo on clear days or at least semi clear days.   Going to this island and not seeing these places would mean that you missed out on the best sights.","Even better in person!","2019-10",,"en","false","2019-10-15T18:53:23-04:00","5","We have seen pictures and videos of this place many times before and we thought: this is the demo version.

From the main road, it takes about 45 mins to reach this spot and then you need to get back. The hike is trivial.
