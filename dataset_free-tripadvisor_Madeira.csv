Even more interesting for us than Caldeiro Verde, was the gorge that is passed shortly before Caldeiro Inferno. It is an extra 2.5 km (one-way) to the Inferno, but -at least for us- with the most strenous passage (300 steps). Once you reach the top, it's not quite obvious where to go next: 2m into the tunnel where it says 'do not enter' and then turn right. In between you cross various tunnels, a headlamp is helpful here (illuminates better than a mobile phone lamp). 
We arrived at the Verde at around 11.30 a.m. and on the way back at around 2 p.m., finally we found the earlier time better because of the light conditions. In comparision to many other hikers parking lots you have to pay here (day ticket 3 €).","Only really good in combination with Caldeiro Inferno","2022-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","74","0","9","71","12","6","0","152","2012-06-03T12:50:43-0400","K","S","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B41D9D4FAD3D5061D4FF0063743DC476","de","0","K S","0",,"user","B41D9D4FAD3D5061D4FF0063743DC476","198436","Detmold, Germany","K S","en","false","2022-07-04T01:47:26-04:00","5","
It was a beautiful walk. The difficulty level is low, the path is very well protected, not recommended for children. We passed through 3 caves, but they are easy to go through, it is advisable to take a flashlight or use the light of the cell phone.

You go up a big long hill, slowly engulfed in the majestic cornucopia of mother natures teet. Then it gets better because it has this awesome car park with a barrier that goes up when you press a button. The more you press it the more bits of paper or gifts you and the more people blow their horns behind you. Weird! Wonderful! Eventually you head along this path along all these massive green trees and there is this irrigation thing constantly going the other direction which I think was water, but it was hard to tell. The path is 8km towards a waterfall. The vibe is very much a humming buzz, like the first lift of adrenaline from acid. You see all these crazy plants and flowers that you only really ever see in films about flowers and plants. It was sort of exciting. 

Anyway, there were a lot of people coming the other way and the path is kind of narrow, so if you’re really obese or American, I’d think twice about going at all. About  halfway along I kind of got bored of plants and flowers and trees and wondered why there were no monkeys or whales or something. Really it’s kind of lame to celebrate it as a cornucopia of nature when the only animal I saw was the part of someone’s sandwich. The views were probably good - I couldn’t really tell because I was too knackered to look at them. After a bit further you really start wondering whether there even is a waterfall. All these glum ungrateful Germans walk the other way looking really unimpressed and barely any of them replied to my greetings and some of them were French, also. Then, god, you have to go through these gross tunnels and it’s dark and there was mud. By the third tunnel I really started hating the place. I mean, just build an escalator up to it or stick some pictures around the place, maybe some music too. The silence bugged me. The trees are all a nasty shade of green. At some point I thought about how pointless nature really is. It doesn’t really do anything and you don’t really get anything off it. I got to the waterfall and it was a massive let down. Actually I got to a sign saying it was another 100m to the waterfall up some stairs and I’d already walked like 7km so I wasn’t doing more. The waterfall has got a nerve and the signage is a con, really, as is nature and so is god. If I wasn’t an atheist I’d probably have asked for my money back but it was free. When I got back some two hours later all the kids were wisely examining their phones to find something better, which may be the smart thing to do come to think of it. Nature sucks. I think they should build a huge open air cinema there to make the most of the awesome car park, then it would get five stars. Other than that, I really loved it.","Wonder-fall","2022-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/21/a6/98/7d/175chetw.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/21/a6/98/7d/175chetw.jpg","8","0","0","1","0","8","0","17","2021-12-17T16:12:51-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.26A5DD76CCFF027D3D35E5C3EC4C9926","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","26A5DD76CCFF027D3D35E5C3EC4C9926","186371","Cheddar, United Kingdom","175chetw","en","false","2022-05-21T09:30:55-04:00","5","Walking along a levada, is an experience not to be missed in Madeira.

Walked it in pouring rain 

Caught no 56 bus at 8.15am from Funchal centre and after a 2 hour bus ride up and over mountains with numerous hairpin bends arrived at Santana. These Madeira bus drivers make the London bus drivers so tame!. Then from Santana took a taxi (cost 10 euros one way) for a 3 mile trip to the start of the walk( No bus avaliable and steep climb up)

Walk was in wet conditions+++ .You need to come well prepared  with proper walking boots, waterproof backpack or items in a plastic bag inside the backpack and whatever the weather take warm waterproof clothing.

Even so we got thoroughly wet through but the waterfalls were magnificent with so much water going over the top etc, walked back through the tunnels using a mobile phone flash light etc . Be careful that you don’t knock your head on the top of the tunnels which can be low in places and also some low overhanging branches.

When finished had a beer/tea/ coffee at one of the cafe’s in Santana ( It had stopped raining then!) and caught the 5.15pm bus back wet but happy that we had achieved this in such bad conditions!","A wet walk","2022-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","4","0","0","5","0","5","0","14","2020-08-18T04:09:56-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.1D3C210492DFCD7842919C3ECEEB6F1D","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","1D3C210492DFCD7842919C3ECEEB6F1D","186338","London, United Kingdom","Cruiser05620647930","en","false","2021-10-05T07:14:12-04:00","5","This is an excellent, typical levada walk, taking in several waterfalls and a couple of view points.

It's not a difficult walk in that it's pretty flat,  however, you are walking along the side of the mountain, on narrow, uneven paths and levada walls and through very dark tunnels (where you'll need to walk bent over) so don't forget to take a torch. There are cable fences along the route so you dont feel at all unsafe, although can see a looong way down.

You have to return the way you came so walk is 13km total. You also have the option of continuing on for another 2.2km ew, which we did, to the so called Devils Cauldron. Slightly more difficult in that there are 70m of steps to navigate and a fairly narrow entrance to a tunnel  but will be fine for most people. 

There is a car park at the start which costs 3 euro, toilets (50c coins only) and a cafe.

This is a wet and much cooler area with muddy paths. Plan on it being around 8 degrees lower in temperature than on the coast.","Excellent levada week in the mountains","2021-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","846","0","160","271","0","451","0","1570","2007-04-16T16:13:09-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F3F655E82E4E187D1234DADEF0089023","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","F3F655E82E4E187D1234DADEF0089023","186406","Chichester, United Kingdom","Jasmine38Chichester","en","false","2021-09-25T13:18:09-04:00","2","Very tame and samey.

It is one of the Island’s oldest Levadas located near Santana which receives 5-6 times more rainfall per annum than Funchal. Indeed, today’s Walk started in lovely sunshine but much of the return Walk (6.25 Kms to Caldeirao Verde and 6.25 Kms back) was in light rain so anyone planning to go on this particular Walk should either take rain gear or at least check the weather forecast!

The Walk itself is predominantly flat with relatively few views due to the heavy tree  cover (not dissimilar to a tropical Rainforest) which does involve keeping a watchful eye on both branches and roots (you have been warned!). Tunnels are another feature (there are 4 - two barely 10/15 metres long but the other two are between 100-150 metres and the ceilings are low in places) so don’t forget your mobile phone or - even better - a torch as you won’t regret it!!

Another tip is to make good use of the security wires as - in addition to steep drops - the path is narrow in places which can make it difficult to let other walkers (fortunately no where near as many as yesterday’s Rabacal Walk!) pass!

All in all, a most enjoyable experience - enhanced by having both an excellent guide (Eduardo) and driver (Daniel) - and one I would gladly recommend to others.","Flat Walk although attention needs paying to Tree branches/roots as well as the Weather Forecast!","2021-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/17/30/0f/6d/steve-b.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/30/0f/6d/steve-b.jpg","626","0","3","188","248","418","0","1234","2015-02-03T02:29:06-0500","Steve","B","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.BF53056D27481B1C4AC5797719EE436E","en_US","0","Steve B","0",,"user","BF53056D27481B1C4AC5797719EE436E","186338","London, United Kingdom","Steve B","en","false","2021-08-27T09:35:07-04:00","4","Firstly the car parking. If you put Quaimades car park in Google navigation it  may send you to the second smaller free car park which is known as Pico dos Pedras car park. Beware that this is nearly three KM from the start of the actual Levada walk.  I guess you don't want to add a boring six k to your 13.5 k walk. 
See the photo and put the right car park of the forestry department : Parque Florestal for navigation. 
It's really a flat walk with very few steps. There is practically no view for first half and it only opens up after the tunnels. It's walking through green canopy which is lovely but may be monotonous. Many other levadas even the extremely popular 25 Fontes had better views. 
Some areas are very narrow. You really don't want to stop and let others pass every two minutes. We went at 2-30 and still had to slow down on several occasions on the way in. On the way out hardly any interpretation and much better experience. You really need to keep your eyes on the path as it'd be very easy to stumble. 
The pool as expected is freezing cold. Saw a few birds including the Firecrest. 
Big car park with traditional houses, toilets, cafe and lots of cats. 
Not bad as an introduction but there are better walks. ","Flat jungle walk, very few view points, choose car parks carefully.

There is a suspended glass platform offering views of Funchal and ocean, and a second platform with a floor. 

I was very underwhelmed by our whole experience. However, I can't really complain as entrance to the viewing platform is free, we just weren't all that impressed by the views. And the crowds of people detracts from the glass floor thrill factor, which you can actually barely see through (see photos) or else it's looking through a thick metal grid. The early morning views are nice enough and it is only a very short easy walk from the carpark, along good paths, so fine for a pram etc.

There is apparently a cable car to travel down to the bottom of the cliffs and see the black rock beaches. The ride is just 3 minutes, with views towards the East. Located 4kms away from the Skywalk, with a separate small carpark. I read that the cost is €5 each but we did not have time to experience this for ourselves.

Located on the south coast, a short drive from Funchal. The skywalk is free to enter and there are public toilets (take change). Open from 8.30am to 8pm. Spend upto half an hour to look at the views.

There is a glass floor viewing platform that you can stand on and admire the views if you are brave enough, looking straight down 580 metres to the shore below, although there are plenty of places to admire the coastal views without using the glass floor. It's one of Europe's tallest cliffs and the views of the surrounding area are well worth a short stop.

The viewing platform overhangs the cliff with a glass floor, fun but not for those who suffer from vertigo.
On the return journey (if using the bus) stand near the Yellow Bus stop the bus comes up the hill and does a three-point turn to head back down the way it came.

We were told it was an easy 3 or 4 km walk. Never having been to Madeira before or heard of Levada walks, we assumed they were a bit like a country hike with some easy slopes. Wrong. Start off with an 800m tunnel anyone over about 5feet 5 will need to duck...if you can see by the light of your phone torch, if you have one...and walk through deep puddles in the dark. Next throw in steep, uneven steps of up to around 200 at once, a narrow path (barely wide enough for one small person) with a sheer drop ""fenced off"" by a 2 wire fence. The end result is beautiful but having an absolute terror of heights and no way of not carrying on with the walk, I was in no fit state to appreciate it. And we had to retrace the narrow path back! So if you have claustrophobia, difficulty climbing and descending uneven steps or a fear of heights AVOID! This walk would not be deemed safe in the UK!","Harrowing!","2022-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/08/63/49/08/tricia-p.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/63/49/08/tricia-p.jpg","44","0","9","16","38","18","0","78","2012-07-13T08:57:49-0400","Tricia","P","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8537C2AC35DE64809700C514B8044495","en_UK","0","Tricia P","0",,"user","8537C2AC35DE64809700C514B8044495","503756","Bexhill-on-Sea, United Kingdom","Tricia P","en","false","2022-05-31T15:30:17-04:00","5","Its a perfect and fresh levada to make on the very hot days on Madera, I definitly recomend it!

These pools are very popular so recommended to visit early on morning or later in afternoon. 

A small fee of €3 each to enter. There are male and female changing areas, with showers and toilets. There are lockers, but as it was very quiet when we visited we just left our bags on one of the large ledges near to the swimming area.

Note: if the sea is particularly wavy the lave pools will be closed, so make sure to go on a calm day. Located on the east of the Island.

I had read that the nearby Aqua Natura Hotel Restaurant is recommended as the views over the volcanic swimming pools and ocean from the balcony seating area are incredible, but we did not have time to visit ourselves.

We had a little stroll through Porto Moniz, which looked like a pleasant tourist town with lots of little shops and cafes and restaurants. There are nice view points overlooking the pools, with the photo frame to take the popular touristy photo.

Mid-April the water was cold at 18degrees, but pleasant enough to swim in for a short while. Then we relaxed in the sun for a while, before continuing on our action packed touristy day -  next stop the black sand beach at Seixel.","picturesque natural swimming pools by the sea","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-03-10T04:43:16-05:00","5","Hi, I visited Porto Maniz just last week and it's a lovely coastal town at the North Western tip of Madeira, spend a few hours here and take in the natural lava pools which fill up with the rising tide, even in March it was still warm enough for swimming, we had 23° that day & it's a lovely place to look around, plenty of nice bars and restaurants too.","Seawater Natural Lava Pools with Views.","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/23/c8/66/iain-k.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/23/c8/66/iain-k.jpg","70","0","0","23","187","5","0","98","2014-07-01T17:29:45-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F7AD35999B827753278A9A472CF861F7","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","F7AD35999B827753278A9A472CF861F7","503790","Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom","iaink2001","en","false","2023-01-25T20:49:26-05:00","5","The ""lava-swimmingpools"" are spectacular!

   Luckily someone on our tour had an extra hand towel so we both shared it to dry off a bit but could not take a shower.
   The pool and its setting are quite spectacular and not crowded at midday in Oct. Water temp was about 22–refreshing and not too cold. You can rent a locker or take your bag out poolside.

On the first the sea was calm & all areas of the pools were open, as was access to the sea. On our second visit the waves coming in were massive & all but the main pool area were closed for safety reasons. The smaller area available for swimming & the waves was more than made up by the fun swimming conditions. Also great for photography.

Some cars were parked on the road- I think most people come earlier. We walked to 25 fortes and back. It wasn’t too crowded- most people were returning to lot as we were walking to waterfalls.  If you are reasonably fit, you will work up a light sweat, but it won’t be too difficult. (Context- 3 smokers in 20s, 1 nonsmoker in 40s- none of us athletes). Some down, some up, some flat, some smooth pavement, some cobblestone. Mostly in shade. Take a jacket because weather changes frequently. There are not many grand views but it is still a very pleasant hike- just watch out for those vans driving the tourists who are not doing the full walk. From the parking lot to 25 fortes and back, it took around 3 hours. I recommend using the WC at the Casa do rabacal, which is about 30 min from the parking lot. It costs 50 Eurocent exact change and is surprisingly clean. Unlike many hikes I’ve done, the land is extremely steep on either side of the trail, so there are few opportunities to find a “nature toilet.”

TL;DR- go late in day, not too hard, nowhere to pee on the trail so plan ahead","Fewer crowds later in the day","2022-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","9","0","0","9","0","18","0","36","2015-09-20T06:43:27-0400","Jessica","A","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.EA3E3508555CDC8553416003B4248018","en_US","0","Jessica A","0",,"user","EA3E3508555CDC8553416003B4248018","60795","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Jessica A","en","false","2022-05-17T06:06:27-04:00","5","If you have time for only one levada choose this one.

Make sure you use the mini bus, which takes you from the parking to the trail head. It's the best 5 Euros (round trip cost) we ever spent. It saves you at least one hour viewless walk. 

The 25 Fontes trail is easy to moderate with some climbs of stairs. You can combine 25 Fontes and Risco into one hike so you see both the upper and lower falls. Risco is very easy, which takes you only 15 extra minutes at the intersection after your way back from 25 Fontes. 

The Levada is admirable work by ancient Madeirans. Walking along it is quite an enjoyment with soothing water sound and lavish greeneries. If you can only do one Levada, do this trail.","This trail has waterfalls, Leveda, and beautiful views!","2022-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","3","0","5","2","0","3","0","8","2006-05-21T00:00:00-0400","gurnee66",".","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.A02820485B255C859F4859E76722CC0A","en_US","0","gurnee66 .","0",,"user","A02820485B255C859F4859E76722CC0A","29196","Alpharetta, Georgia","gurnee66 .","en","false","2022-01-01T08:57:51-05:00","5","Our new year’s hike.

When we arrived there was no one around at all and we were feeding the birds from our hands just a few minutes down the path - take bird seed :-) 

The walk down to the actual walk (down the road from the parking spot) is pretty long and when you hit the Rabacal House which is closed before 9/10am the actual walk starts. A very easy few km to Risco waterfall which is stunning but sadly did not have much water yet as theyd had a dry spell but very friendly birds there again to feed! 

Then you go back on yourself and walk down a number of steps towards 25 Fontes which is a canyon with 25 springs running down the walls. It was pretty but the number of people took away from it in our experience as lots of tours come here - it was super busy even in November so goodness knows what its like in peak season. 

An easy walk for the most part but about 600m of ascent and descent if you take the road up and down. I would advise you take the bus back up the road when you get back to Rabacal house, we chose not to, I do not know why but it was a hard walk back up in the heat and nothing to see as its just a tarmacked road but once we committed we just did it. Next time we would get the bus back up though. 

The cafe is nice and has toilets and nice food, cakes and drinks, a welcome treat after the walk.","Nice walk, very busy!","2021-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1d/85/92/46/inwanderment.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/85/92/46/inwanderment.jpg","138","0","112","66","0","66","0","270","2008-06-26T17:17:40-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FB6F2B6C39535C5F70C95D55B219FA3A","en_us","0",,"0",,"user","FB6F2B6C39535C5F70C95D55B219FA3A","186301","Herefordshire, United Kingdom","Inwanderment","en","false","2021-10-27T14:11:38-04:00","5","A lovely easy well marked hike.

The drive up from Funchal is pretty steep and takes about an hour (rather quicker 45 mins back down). Reasonable amount of car parking but toilets only available by the cafe. 

All the trails are well signposted so you really don't need a guide. Expect the temperature to be around 8 degrees cooler than the coast. 

Most of the trails are pretty easy and vertigo free although there are plenty of steps. We walked for around 4.5 hours total, covering 12 miles and took in 25 Fontes, Risco and Lagos da Vento. The Risco waterfall is the most impressive and the shortest trail if you are time limited.

There is a very nice cafe with sandwiches, great cake and coffee options as well as some hot dishes. If you don't want to walk down (or back up both around 30 mins) there is a minibus service for 3 euro or 5 euro return.

There are 2 nice cafes, 2 covered exhibitions and so much outdoor space. We stayed for well over 3 hours just walking through the gardens. The views are amazing and the fish ponds were just so relaxing. Half way down the garden there is an area where you can see the people coming down in the baskets.

The museum ​​is housed across three buildings, two of are dedicated to sculptures and the third houses a unique mineral collection. We spent more time that expected in the museums as there was heavy rain when we arrived, but then the day brightened up beautifully.

​​The gardens are located on top of a steep hill, but the paths are good and there are plenty of places to rest. I understand that there is also a golf cart service available to take visitors back up to the entrance/exit at the top of the gardens, but we did not use this.

We spent hours walking along the many paths and admiring the colourful foliage in the gardens. We took a meander around the tranquil pond, visited the beautiful oriental gardens with the koi ponds and many decorative bridges. There are so many amazing little paths and routes to explore, and so many interesting things to discover! From hidden waterfalls, ornate bridges, stepping stones over a pond, water features, hundreds of statues and hidden sculptures, many beautiful decorative tiles. There is sooo much to see I can't possibly describe it to full justice, just take my word for it and go visit yourself! 

Don't forget to pick up your free glass of Madeira from the cafe at the bottom of the gardens (no purchase necessary). Cafe has mixed reviews so we didn't eat here but it is definitely worth a visit just for the little glass of Madeira, that is included with your ticket, we had to try Madeira while in Madeira!

I took soooo many photos, literally hundreds! and could happily have spent most of the day here, wandering around the many little paths and exploring all the little different areas of the gardens.

If I had to choose, my favourite parts might be the Japanese gardens and around the main pond area - there are little pathways you can take to walk all the way around the pond, involving getting splashed by the mini waterfalls and even walking underneath the larger waterfall! and you can also walk out to the little island on the pond.

We visited in May and I don't think the gardens were at their best, as quite a cold and rainy year so not much had flowered. I would love to return again some day in early summer when all the flowers are in bloom.

We visited these gardens on an action packed day; starting with the cable ride up the hill, a wonderful visit to these gardens and then the second cable car ride to the Madeira Botanical Gardens, which fail in comparison but we thought are worthwhile a visit as you are so close. Afterwards we enjoyed the fun touristy toboggan ride, before getting the cable car back down to Funchal and having a walk along the promenade by the sea. A very busy and fun day! The highlight of our day was definitely the Monte Palace Tropical Gardens for us.

The cable car station at the top of the hill is literally right next to the garden entrance. Remember to pick up a map at the entrance, which shows the two different walking routes you can take; a flower walk and an art walk. There is lots of walking involved to see all the garden and some steep areas, so definitely wear comfortable shoes. We spent around 4 hours walking around the gardens, but I could so easily have spent much longer here. Tickets are €12.50 each. Open from 9.30am to 6pm daily.","A MUST VISIT - one of my favourite activities that we did in Madeira - and we did a lot!","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-03-10T06:30:08-05:00","4","Definitely worth the 25 euros for the 2 of us, and we did enjoy strollilng round.

Just not the variety I was expecting. The landscaping and water features are nice. Enjoyable, and I'd maybe try going again maybe later in the year, possibly there is more variety then, but in February it didn't have as much as I expected.

It gets crowded in the morning—especially since it's also the trailhead for the famous Pico do Arieiro to Pico Ruivo hiking route—so get there early to snag a good spot. On a clear day, you may even be able to see the neighboring island of Porto Santo that's 30 miles away.

Tours typically start from Funchal and will bring you to Pico do Arieiro at sunrise to start the hike to Pico Ruivo.

However, my rating is for the facilities and the actual experience here. It is certainly overcrowded and the bus loads of people from tour operators and coaches really doesn’t help. The air defence station positioned up there is certainly an eyesore and the development of the cafe/canteen and souvenir shop certainly doesn’t help.

I got up around 05.30 and set off around 06.15 to get there around 07.00 just before sunrise & the crowds. Pick your spot and watch the sun come up above the clouds, you have to pick your timing as it's not always clear up there. Once the sun had come up I set off on the PR1 hiking trail to Pico Ruivo, most reviews say give yourself around 6 hours for the round trip, I did it in around 4.5 hours and was back at the car park for a well earned Coffee & Pastel de Nata!
It's not for the feint hearted as the going can get tiring as there's plenty of steps to climb, especially near the end, but you'll get some stunning views of the mountains, so it's well worth it, take plenty of snacks & water + layer up as the wind can hit you when you least expect it. If you come to the island this is a must see & do location.","Sunrise, Mountains, Clouds, Stunning!","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/23/c8/66/iain-k.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/23/c8/66/iain-k.jpg","70","0","0","23","187","5","0","98","2014-07-01T17:29:45-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F7AD35999B827753278A9A472CF861F7","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","F7AD35999B827753278A9A472CF861F7","503790","Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom","iaink2001","en","false","2023-02-11T04:58:45-05:00","4","Quite a busy place but the starting point for further adventures.

When the sun started to rise, the views had been just magnificent - the sun rays reflected both on the surrounding mountains and on the ocean in a variety of colours - shades of orange and pink. That view will stay with me for the rest of my life. We were very lucky with the weather as the sky was almost cloudless, so we decided to hike to Pico Ruivo and it was the most amazing hike, with spectacular views all the way. Not at all tiring and not too dangerous in my opinion as there are rails all the way to the other peak.

The top lot is meant for brief visits under an hour.   The walkway to the starting point is not well illustrated from the bottom, so you may end up walking on the road.

The visitor center at Pico do Arieiro has a clean toilet for 50 cents per person, and a cafe and souvenir shop.  We stopped off before beginning the hike, and our plan was to do a round trip to Pico Ruivo and back.   All in all, it took us about 7 hours, including a 45 min rest at the cafe/toilets near Pico Ruivo.   We are 2 adults and a teenager.   The path for this hike is clear and does not require advanced technical gear.  However, the hike is strenuous, and other than one family with small children, everyone else we saw that day were teenagers or older.   

The path has significant ascents and descents, some on stone stairs, and some on medal stairs close to ladders in steepness.   Most of the path was on dirt or stones.  Part of the hike is in the shade, but much of it is in the open sun so suncream is essential.   The path traverses multiple tunnels, some of which are long enough that light cannot pass through, so a torch is necessary.  One tunnel had a wet floor, so the light was particularly important to avoid stepping in deep puddles or slipping.

The cafe near Pico Ruivo is staffed by people who hike there each day, with no car access, so you need to carry your own rubbish away.  You can buy drinks and small snacks, and they do accept credit cards.   There was just one working toilet and quite a queue for it.  There was also one sink with running water.  People were refilling bottles, although not clear if it was meant to be drinking water.  At one point, the tap ran dry, and needed 30 min to refill the cistern to begin pumping water again.

If you reach that cafe and consider turning around before the final climb to Pico Ruivo, do not turn around!!  The view from Pico Ruivo is a 360-degree view of the mountains including Nun's Valley, and was the highlight of the day.  Totally worth the extra effort to get there.

On the way out, we saw many people on the hike.  On the way back, there were relatively few people.  Many of them must have made arrangements to be picked up on the other side, so just walked one way.  

We were exhausted the next day after this epic hike, but the views were well worth the effort.  Bring a hat, suncream, a torch, snacks, and lots and lots of water.","Epic hike","2022-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/3d/c2/e3/tangek.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/3d/c2/e3/tangek.jpg","98","0","323","54","146","32","0","185","2005-03-08T00:00:00-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.4D1AF691C539E9904E49BBFBCE9BF0FB",,"0",,"0",,"user","4D1AF691C539E9904E49BBFBCE9BF0FB","186338","London, United Kingdom","tangek","57","Nature & Parks",,,,,"#6 of 446 things to do in Madeira","66","Mountains",,,,,,,,,,,,"Atlantic/Madeira","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189167-d4740534-Reviews-Pico_do_Arieiro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html","http://www.netmadeira.com/webcams-madeira/pico-do-arieiro","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189167-d4740534-Pico_do_Arieiro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

Octopus and Dorado were cooked to perfection and came with sweet potato, baked potato and salad, mostly from the restaurants own garden.

The tour was both very informative and also relaxed, you could feel yourself immersed in the sheer beauty of everything around. It is a magic place and I cannot recommend it highly enough for all that it offers. The fruit tasting at the end was also great, we tasted fruit that we did not know it even exist, everything fresh and delicious.
After the fruit tasting we had lunch and we chose some dishes prepared with vegetables and fruit from their garden, the food was very tasty and the service very friendly and fast. Of course, we also enjoyed the beach in front of the restaurant, the water was crystal clear, calm and warmer than on other beaches we visited on the island.","Magical place","2022-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2012-01-02T06:50:35-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.379CEAA1EFEA03E5E13890990E43E489","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","379CEAA1EFEA03E5E13890990E43E489","294458","Bucharest, Romania","danielabruma","en","false","2022-08-01T05:49:36-04:00","1","Worst part of our whole holiday.

Then the food wasn’t cooked so we didn’t eat anything. Everyone looked annoyed and I can’t see how anyone had a good time. Also no running water in the toilets which did not bode well for the kitchen. 

Location was nice, but small. Not worth the cable car trip down. The cable car in Funchal FAR better and longer. Also the beach area was small and everyone just sat on concrete. Much nicer areas around. Can also see the plants and bananas trees on most levada walks.

We caught the 137 bus from Funchal (€2.20 pp) to Camera do Lobos & then a taxi (€15) to Faja dos padres. Because we did not pre arrange a taxi back, we walked quite a distance along some busy roads / bad bends asking locals the way.

I was terribly disappointed with both the food and the service which was diabolical.  After waiting for 30 minutes and being totally ignored, whilst people around me were getting service, I went up and asked if I could get some service!  Without any apology I was given the menu.  When my food arrived, I had to request olive oil, salt etc which should have automatically been put on the table and yet it took a further five minutes to arrive and when I asked for a second glass of wine half way through my meal, it didn't arrive until I had finished the food, ten minutes later. The food was not any better than other places on the island, but more expensive and the fish portion size was too small for the price charged, although the Mango sauce was good.  When you add in the ten euro cost of getting there, it ended up being a big expensive let down.   They need to either improve their waiting staff, or get a big sign telling people to order food and drinks at the bar.

The fruit tasting was much better than we expected.   There were all kinds of fruits to try and she also gave us information about each one as we tried it.

Unfortunately we were located next to a group of brash, loud Canadians who continually played music at full volume, and loudly shared stories punctuated with bad language to embarrassed visitors.

The views alone are worth the cost. 12.50 Euros one way if your going to be adventurous enough to chance the toboggan down. Just be prepared for a long wait at the top if you are. Either way, don't try walking down from the top. Its just too far and too steep a journey.

The views are pretty good, but ride is a must to visit Monte Palace Tropical Gardens, which are fabulous.

We paid €68 for cable car return plus Botanical Gardens tickets for 2 adults. The journey takes upto 20 minutes. Open from 9am to 5.45pm. Try to get seats with your back to the ascent. The base station is located in the garden of Almirante Reis, in the main area of Funchal, just a couple of minutes walk from where all the busses drop you off.

We arrived when the station opened at 9am and were lucky we didn't have to queue for any of the cable cars we took that day, although we did car share with another couple on some journeys. The staff were all friendly and it was quick and easy to buy our tickets and walk through - there is a board clearly indicating the prices for the different ticket types.

The Botanical Gardens were nice to see but not comparable to Monte Palace. However the cable car ride to the Botanical Gardens was much for scenic. It is just a couple of minutes journey on this cable car. Be aware that it is quite a long walk away - and all up a steep hill on the way back! I was heavily pregnant and just took it slowly. It would be hard work pushing a pram. 

As you leave the cable car station, Monte Palace Tropical Garden is immediately to the left (highly recommend this) and the walk to the cable car for Botanical Gardens is to the right, both well sign posted.","A fun touristy thing to do to get to the beautiful gardens at the top of the hill","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-03-10T06:21:50-05:00","4","Very long queues ( we arrived mid morning on 2nd March so not exactly peak season. 25 euro for both of us to go up, as we were choosing to get a toboggan down. Best to read up on your options before you go as you can get combined tickets with gardens (of which there are two up there) and there is also another cable car which we were unaware of. If you turn to the left when you get out it takes you to Monte palace and toboggans. If you go right it takes you to the other set of cable cars which go to the other gardens.

The walk took us about an hour and a bit each way and was of moderate intensity. There are steep bits at the end but not too difficult to manage unless you find climbing extended stairs difficult. Just before the peak there is a house/cafe that serves drinks (although not refrigerated these were still nice and cold). 

The views from the top are spectacular and we got lucky with our day featuring a low layer of cloud that we were above for the entire walk. It must be even more spectacular when it's a completely clear day. There were a few tour groups but it wasn't too busy. They were generally very good at letting faster walkers past as well.

The sign at the light also says the roadworks are from 10am - 5pm so maybe try the car outside these hours. Otherwise you can park at pedras and it's a 5km walk uphill which will take 1.5 hrs.

There’s an interesting collection of vintage wines, machinery and other objects relating to winemaking. Tours available daily except Sundays and allow you to visit the various areas of the Lodge, followed by a wine tasting. 

I was planning on booking on one of the following tours, having seen these advertised on the website: Premier Tour is 45 Minutes at €11.00 or Vintage Tour is 60 Minutes at €22.90. But when we requested the next English speaking tour, we were charged only €15.75 for 2 tickets, so guess there's more tour options? 

Our tour lasted about 45 minutes which was just the right amount of time really, as you take in a lot of information. The tour was fun/interesting yet informative, and then there was a great tasting at the end where we each got to sample 2 different Madeiras.

I read online that tours run Monday - Friday: 10:30, 14:30, 15:30, 16:30 (on request), Saturdays 10:30. But please double check this yourself on their website as our visit was several months ago now. We just turned up and requested the next English tour, which was running in 20 minutes, so we went outside and sat in the pretty little garden just outside and had a walk around in the sun for a few minutes.

There is a small central courtyard area near to where you have the tasting, and the toilets are here next to the Blandy's gift shop.

Very central located, in the heart of Funchal. Unfortunately you can't seem to book online or via telephone? so you have to pop in and hope for the best, or if walking past step inside and book your tour for another day. This is the only area of improvement I could suggest as online booking would have been our preference.","Taste the Madeira Wine at Blandy’s Wine Lodge - a must do while in Madeira","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-03-09T05:03:43-05:00","5","A very instructive tour by Sophia telling us all we needed to know about the complexity of producing vintage Madeira.

There is a variety of tours you can take, I strongly recommend that you book ahead of time online because the tours are normally fully booked.

I had read comments about their rudeness in other reviews on Tripadvisor, but thought people were just being a bit OTT. But, oh no, it’s absolutely true. Probably the worst experience I’ve had in a very long while.

We were given a brief tasting in our hotel yesterday and I spoke to the lovely lady afterwards about booking availability for today. She said it would be okay and said the hotel could book for me. Unfortunately they could not get through on the phone so we said that we would book in person.

When we arrived at Blandy’s, the lady (I use that word loosely) on reception told me that they were fully booked. I tried to explain the scenario briefly outlined above and she just dismissed me saying that it didn’t matter what I said, they were fully booked. I tried to explain twice but she just cut me off both times. She was so incredibly rude: what she is doing in a customer facing role is beyond me.

I had been eagerly looking forward to the visit, but I no longer have any desire to give them a second thought. And I certainly won’t be touching another drop of their Madeira wine.

She rushed us thru our tour just to get away from that badly behaved child. Not good PR for Blandy’s & certainly not the tour we expected.  :(

I wrote to Blandy's about this, suggesting that if they choose to allow children to accompany their parents, they should have a disclaimer stating that children are expected to behave well for the sake of everyone in the tours & if not, parents will be asked to remove the ill behaved child.
Their reply:
""Thank you for your for letting us know what happened. 
We truly hope that on your next visit you will have a better experience.

Well worth the trip and just a short walk from centre of Funchal.","Great tasting experience","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","70","0","27","23","16","86","0","179","2013-03-02T14:04:33-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.098F5623B9CC5D96E14C0452FDE4AD00","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","098F5623B9CC5D96E14C0452FDE4AD00","186395","Warwickshire, United Kingdom","LynnK21","en","false","2022-12-04T07:10:09-05:00","4","The tour was very informative.

We weren't that impressed with the jobsworth-ess of a young lady on reception, she was very po-faced when we arrived.   So my husband booked himself in for 10.30 am on the following Monday morning (just before we left for the airport) and managed to have a tour and a tasting, which he really enjoyed, and found very interesting.  Different style to Barbeito though.  He did buy a bottle to take home as a souvenir and to enjoy with friends over Christmas.","Blandys Wine Lodge Funchal","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/19/4c/24/platpeeps.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/19/4c/24/platpeeps.jpg","135","0","31","107","0","338","0","580","2009-03-02T01:50:52-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.DDFA352922F484B4F5E2A8F5EFDE2689","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","DDFA352922F484B4F5E2A8F5EFDE2689","186402","Birmingham, United Kingdom","platpeeps","36","Food & Drink",,,,,"#44 of 446 things to do in Madeira","132","Wineries & Vineyards",,,,,,,,,,,,"Atlantic/Madeira","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189167-d271927-Reviews-Blandy_s_Wine_Lodge-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html","http://www.blandyswinelodge.com","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189167-d271927-Blandy_s_Wine_Lodge-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

There are no trees and the area looks totally different to the rest of Madeira and was very very different to our other hikes. The scenery is starkly beautiful and we took so many photos. I have such great memories of this walk, I cannot recommend highly enough.

A clearly defined, and very popular, walking trail starts from the car park and leads you across the cliffs. This coastal 8km track leads to the furthest eastern point of the island with spectacular ocean and cliff views, then back again. We arrived very early in the morning and the carpark was empty, but when we left mid-afternoon the carpark was jam packed!

We had read that the hike is quite strenuous in parts with steeper sections up and down, and that hiking poles are useful, but this did not prepare me for how tiring I would find it. Recommended to allow 3-4 hours to enjoy the walk, but we spent over 5 hours as I was heavily pregnant and we took it very slowly.

Be warned, this hike is definitely not one to do on a windy day. It wasn't windy at all when we started our hike, but parts of the route are so exposed that the wind just gusts past you. There are sections where we were so exposed (luckily for only short periods of time or else I would have had to turn back) where my husband was literally gripping my hand as I felt like I might blow away - even at 8 months pregnant! I was a little unsteady on my feet anyway and the baby belly must have been catching the wind even more than usual! lol

Conveniently there is a cafe, Casa do Sardinho, at the further end of the trail. It's in a great location with tables outside and a marvellous view down to the bay and back along the promontory. The food is quite pricey however and there is a cost of €1 to use the toilets. There is also a picnic area and picnic tables by the rocks on the sea shore at the landing jetty a couple of hundred metres below the cafe.

Beyond the cafe there is one final walking opportunity up to the summit of the last accessible hill on the promontory. I had read that this is ""up a steepish but well-made path with steps and should take about 25 minutes up and down again"". While this may have been true at one point when we visited in April 2022 this was definitely NOT the case!I didn't make it up the final push to the top of the cliff for the views across the sea as the path was so very severely eroded. I have uploaded photos as you wouldn't believe the condition of the path, it was worse than scrambling. Being heavily pregnant and the path being so steep and eroded, I opted to sit on the side of the steep path while my husband finished the climb to the top - to take photos for me of the views out to the furthest end of the island

Overall an absolutely magnificent walk and of course a great contrast to levada walking. Ponta de São Lourenço is recommended as a great place for sunrise and sunset. A very popular tourist destination it is therefore recommended to arrive early, hike and leave before the crowds, apparently cars are usually queuing to get into the free carpark by 11am.

I had read that this was is easily accessible by Bus 113 from Funchal for €3.50, so we took a Bolt direct from our hotel outside of Funchal for €24 and then opted for the bus back to central Funchal. I very much regret taking the bus back! as it seemed to take hours, stopping constantly to pick up passengers as it is very much a local bus and not an express bus. Plus you have to get off and swap busses in another town on the way, such a carry on. Grab is so cheap and convenient, we would definitely recommend this instead.

A total contrast to our other hikes on the island (Levada do Furado (PR10) and Vereda dos Balcões de Ribeiro Frio (PR11)) but we loved this walk too, for completely different reasons.","I have such great memories of this walk, I cannot recommend highly enough - absolutely amazing scenery","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-01-28T07:08:26-05:00","5","The most eastern coast of Madeira offers outstanding views of the nature.

Breathtaking 360 degree views once you reach the tip top and even if you don’t go all the way you’ll see some awesome views of the cliffs and ocean.  That all said - be prepared! Have good walking footwear and sunscreen and be prepared for high winds. I’m a 50+ woman in pretty good shape but it was challenging - especially coming down. My legs got wobbly. We started up around 9:30 am (the earlier the better due to crowds) and got back to parking lot around 12:30 with a stop for cold drink on way down. There is a WC at the cafe which has a decent offering of food and drink. And when you get back two food trucks are there with cold refreshments and food.

It was a leisure 2.5 hours walk from the carpark (including many stop for photos an flying drone) to reach the lookout point. Would definitely recommend people to do this hike while in Madeira.

Walking is hard going in places, sometimes with only the guard wire rope rail to protect you from a potentially fatal tumble. Not for the faint hearted. 
However the views are stunning in places. 
We started at 1030 taking it easy and was 2 hours to the coffee shop.
Very very busy…..walkers in the hundreds  if not thousands . Very busy in places.
Decided to take the boat back, 10 eu per head, incl a bit of a guided tour looking for seals back to Quinta dos Lordes marina.

It’s not a easy hike especially after the shop/cafe part. If you decide to give up now, you can catch a boat ride near the cafe and they will take you near the car park.
Now, after the cafe they hike get harder in my opinion as it’s steep and lots of steps but once you get to the top you are rewarded with a beautiful view.
On the way down, stick to the path on your right as it’s flatter and easier than the steps on your left.

We are accustomed walkers but this path is an accident waiting to happen. The wind was blowing people off track and some of the children walking had to stop themselves from being blown over. The previous reviews identify many of the problems and risk associated with this path, and on a good day with few people I'm sure the views are magnificent. But as expected, it is a victim of its own success. Anyone who says this is an easy walk must have done it when there is no wind and no other tourist blocking the path for the infamous selfie or instagram shot , oblivious to needs of others. Read Christian M's review , it is honest and clear about the reality of this path. If you have have  children or babies , think twice about what risks you and they will be taking if the weather is not perfect. We saw a number of sensible parents turn around after the second incline steps . realising the problems of trying to go on.

This wonderful and scenic walk is 6,7 km all in all. It takes 2-2,5 hours if you are fairly fit (we are almost 60 years old, and it took us 2,20 hours including time to take pictures and a 10 minute break halfway where we had some fruit and water that we brought ourselves).

The walk is among the most popular things-to-do in Madeira (no. 15 on Tripadvisor) - and though it’s quite strenuous you’ll meet lots of people, also children and elderly.

START EARLY! Park your car well before 9 AM (you’ll be among the first) - when you return to the parking lot a couple of hours later there will be hundreds of cars and buses …. You will meet all these people - and have to step aside for each and everyone - on the narrow path on your way back!

BRING walking shoes, maybe walking sticks (we didn’t), water, cap/hat and dress according to weather conditions. Don’t go if it has just been raining - or promise us to be extremely careful. Too much wind can be annoying, too. Also remember to go to the toilet before you start.

THE TRACK starts very easy, but soon gets more rough. Up and down it goes (it’s not af walk in the park), and most of the way you will have to concentrate where you place your feet. The drops down the cliffs are pretty serious - but on the worst parts of the track there are ropes for your protection.

HALFWAY is a bar - but it was closed when we got there at 10 AM in the morning. At this point of the walk is a small loop that goes through the bar area - take it counter-clockwise. There is a hill you can climb if you fancy more action and views (we didn’t).

This walk is a must-do in Madeira, much much more interesting than any levada … HOWEVER: Personally, I’m a little frightened by heights and the risc of falling down cliffs - to me the walk was quite a challenge, but I did it and I was proud afterwards.","Magnificent walk (and a little frightening, to be honest)","2022-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1d/07/1d/f2/christian-m.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/07/1d/f2/christian-m.jpg","771","0","127","182","191","578","0","1532","2012-11-10T08:29:56-0500","Christian","M","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8F577E9F9A96B07A165C586BD906CE2B","da_DK","0","Christian M","0",,"user","8F577E9F9A96B07A165C586BD906CE2B","189541","Copenhagen, Denmark","Christian M","57","Nature & Parks",,,,,"#7 of 446 things to do in Madeira","68","Nature & Wildlife Areas",,,,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/animal-welfare-education-portal/","Learn more","Click below for expert advice on animal welfare in tourism.","This attraction features animals","Features Animals",,,"Atlantic/Madeira","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1902264-d1492139-Reviews-Ponta_de_Sao_Lourenco-Canical_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html",,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g1902264-d1492139-Ponta_de_Sao_Lourenco-Canical_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

From Funchal take Nos 56, 103 or 138 buses to Santana and disembark at Ribeiro Frio. I read that the cost is €2.75 each but for the convenience and hour saved we took a Bolt direct from our hotel just outside of Funchal for €21. From the bus stop, walk a little way downhill to find the track on the left, which is signposted for Balcões, just past the start of the Ribeiro Frio to Portela walk on your right. 

A wide, level path takes you along the levada (irrigation channel), through a forest and past a very rustic café before leading you onto a viewing platform with incredible views over the Ribeira da Metade valley. In addition, you’ll see the Laurisilva forest, classified as a World Heritage by UNESCO. The island’s highest peaks, Pico do Areeiro, Pico do Gato, and Pico das Torres, are also visible. 

This is a lovely little walk through the forest and then you are rewarded with absolutely amazing views! Suitable for pretty much everyone, there is no reason not to go on this walk - you could even manage it with a sturdy pram! We set off very early to avoid the crowds and there was only a couple more people at the view point, on the way back however we passed several couples/families.

Tip: Take bread from breakfast to feed the very friendly birds here. 

Located in Ribeiro Frio natural park. The mountains are covered in thick forest, and you’ve got a view all the way out to the sea on a clear day. Note: this area is very prone to mist and cloud cover, so plan in advance and check visibility on NetMadeira before making the drive.

I read that the Ribeiro Frio Restaurant near the entrance to the walk to the Vereda dos Balcões is highly recommended and also very reasonably priced. The prego (Madeiran steak sandwich) is very popular and made here with Bolo do Caco bread which is delicious. However, half way towards the Vereda dos Balcões (viewpoint) there is a rustic cafe which looked lovely, we would have visited but it was still early morning and we had a long day of hiking ahead of us (and full packed lunches in our backpacks).

We combined this short walk with the longer Levada do Furado (PR10), which finishes in Portela. This was hard work as I was heavily pregnant but I loved this hike so much. Walking past many little waterfalls and even underneath a couple! There were narrow walkways to traverse with precipices on one side! and even short dark caves to walk through!

We, therefore, picked this easy walk of about 3km that end at a viewing platform with magnificent views of the mountains on the opposite side of the valley along with sea views of the north coast.  You can also feed the local birds; some will feed from your hand.  We'd hired a taxi for the day.  He dropped us off in Ribeiro Frio and I've never seen so many cars/coaches in such a small town but there is another more difficult walk going from this town also.  About halfway along the track there is a small cafe.  On the way back we played Pooh Sticks where the lavada seemed straight enough to follow their progress.

Madeira has long been called the ""Garden Isle"" and it seems that almost anything will grow in its fertile soil.The Palheiro gardens are situated at about 500 meters above sea level and were started in 1801 by the original owner the Conde de Carvalhal.

There are many small areas to explore including Camellia Avenue, Sunken Garden, Rose Garden, Long Border and the Ladies' Garden - which is where you find the tea house, which seems to be highly recommended in other reviews. There is also the Ribeiro do Inferno, a deep valley with tree ferns and indigenous plants. We particularly enjoyed exploring this area, although the paths would not be suitable for anyone with limited mobility or a pushchair.

The paths in the main garden areas are mostly good and although the gardens are spread out, there's not too much walking required to get around and see it all, although there is initially quite a long walk of 10 minutes or more to actually arrive at the gardens from the main gate.

We happily spent a couple of hours walking around, but in late April there wasn't nearly as many flowers to see as I had been expecting, so I imagine a visit in May/June to be much better. I did particularly enjoy seeing the yellow poppies however. There are a couple of lovely view points too. The gardens were very quiet when we visited with not many other visitors.

There is a bus stop right outside the main entrance, and a bus timetable with full information on how to get to Funchal - take Nos 36 or 37 buses. We were going to get a bus but found Bolt (the local equivalent of Uber or Grab) so quick and easy to use and so reasonably priced that we opted for a quicker car ride to the next attraction on our fun packed touristy day.

Open daily from 9am to 5pm. Tickets are €10 each. We recommend to spend upto 2 hours exploring the gardens.","Not our favourite garden in Funchal, but we enjoyed a couple of hours wandering around in the sunshine","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-03-19T08:08:30-04:00","3","Lovely open space, beautiful views from there.

However, to visit the place you need to pay more than to visit other better places such as the botanical gardens and Monte Palace). There is not very regular busses going up there essentially during the weekend so there is pretty good chance you might get ripped off from the taxi service around.
The quality of the food and the drinks in the Tea rooms is pretty average, in fact we had the worst BTL sandwich ever.

Much less crowded than Monte Gardens, there is much to enjoy here in the varied planting that includes South African as well as native species.
For a person with mobility issues it’s not ideal; there are the usual small cobbles, steps and steep slopes, with no buggy available. (The so-called disabled loo at the entrance is up a cobbled slope.)
The tea room seems to cope with the number of visitors, and there are large and unusual cakes on offer to go with your mug of Tetley’s.
We were hoping there might be packets of seeds on sale, but that wasn’t the case.
Anyway, a pleasant visit to a peaceful garden.","Varied and enjoyable planting","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/12/09/4c/hoteljunkie99.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/12/09/4c/hoteljunkie99.jpg","34","0","44","108","0","140","0","282","2010-06-14T04:39:38-0400","Jane","G","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.59A091A435B5A4D26BB9D74C605EF85D","en_UK","0","Jane G","0",,"user","59A091A435B5A4D26BB9D74C605EF85D","503827","Emsworth, United Kingdom","Jane G","en","false","2023-03-09T05:00:03-05:00","5","What a delight to go round this garden with representative flora from many parts of the world, especially South Africa.

The walk from the entrance is also much less steep than Monte and takes you through an avenue of camellias.
It has an excellent snack bar at the bottom of the garden with delicious pastries.
The one challenge is the bus timetable - in particular there is a 2 hour gap for getting back in the afternoon.

It’s a very scenic walk all the way - most of the track is on nice pavement, so ordinary trainers are fine. The hard part is the fact that most of the way is either up, up, up or down, down, down.

Start the walk on the corner outside Pizzaria la Carbonara - ask the GPS in your smartphone to guide you to ‘Miradouro do Cristo Rei do Garajau’ on foot.

If you go by car there is free parking just before the statue.

In front of the parking lot you’ll find a cable car that can take you to the pebbled beach at Garajau.

We had visited Blandy's in the morning and there is a tourist office right next door which directed us to the correct bus stop. If you head to the cable car area and right to the top of where the buses are, near to the Madeira Story Centre, the last stand will be for bus no.155 to Garajau. It cost about 2.40 euros pp each way. We sat on the two person seat on the bus which was very tight and we are small and so make sure you grab the three-seater! I used the GPS on my phone to work out where we had to get off but it wasn't exactly easy and we did have to check with our driver. Get off opposite restaurant Neptuno. Then head straight over the roundabout down a steep hill and it's a steep winding road down (signposted too). We had checked the timetable and were not too sure of the return trip and so made sure we were back for the next obvious bus which gave us about a 45 minute time slot to get down, look around and get back. We are 36 and 40 and are quite fit and so managed it with time to enjoy the statue and time to spare. But be warned the return trip back is steep and it was a sweaty journey back up!! The return bus is near to Tourigalo restaurant.

We were told by another British tourist that this was the prototype for the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio and it's pretty similar. No entry charge you just walk up to it. Plenty of parking nearby if you're driving. There is also a restaurant there which would have been lovely to stop at and have a nice drink overlooking the beautiful views....if only we had time. There are steps down from the statue which are worth going down to take the picture looking back up.

And the walk down, to look up at it is worth it. I took the cable car down to the beach because I read the drive down was treacherous. The drive is nothing, and it’s on a paved road. Definitely drive down instead of taking cable car. It is 3 euro round trip but there is nothing more to see than you can see from the top anyways. Plus the operator never had change for a 5 so I had to pay 5, go down, and buy something so that I could give him the exact amount when I went back up. Then when you are trying to get back up, you rely on him seeing you on his camera in able to bring you up, as there is nobody down there. I stood there for several minutes, jumping up and down and waving my arms. It’s not used much so he obviously didn’t pay attention ","Monument very good, cable car not","2020-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","33","0","4","79","0","30","0","142","2007-02-13T13:50:25-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D40B3282E728F57B1ABEBDF8C07AC07D","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","D40B3282E728F57B1ABEBDF8C07AC07D","182213","Yorkton, Canada","xrayvision","en","false","2020-03-03T07:33:17-05:00","3","The walk way and steps have very well presented ( clearly the latter has been renovated recently) Amazing views - even on a grey day

It doesn't seem to be on the typical list of places to visit. It's a statue of Christ at the end of a parking lot, with a steep paved trail that goes down to a promontory.The views are really nice.There is also a road and cable car that go down to the beach, a long way below. The parking (at the top) is free, not sure how much the cable car is, we didn't take it. 

To put it in perspective, it was our last day and we wanted to do something easy and close by (to the hotel) and this fit the bill perfectly. It was a very warm day, and we just sat on a bench for quite some time. I walked down and back up the trail to the end of the headland. It's not too far, but relatively steep, so you have to be reasonably healthy and capable to do it.

We were staying at the Ocean Gardens hotel in Sao Goncalo. From there, go through Garajau to the roundabout and you'll see a sign ""Cristo Rei"". You go down the hill through a residential area until you reach the parking lot. 

Nothing special, but a nice place to sit outside and enjoy the views.","Underrated place to visit in Madeira","2019-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","16","0","1","10","0","6","0","32","2011-05-11T11:23:47-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.EC1CC45CE39286E34A043DC234B3579B","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","EC1CC45CE39286E34A043DC234B3579B","41879","Walpole, Massachusetts","GFW57","en","false","2019-12-02T09:11:27-05:00","5","Myself and my partner visited on the first day of our trip and it was absolutely beautiful.

We went here thrice on our 6 Day stay in Madeira.

 it’s a small bay very beautiful with natural outcrop of rocks and a natural underwater reserve. There is the huge statue of Christ like the one in Rio de Janerio on the top . 

The best bits are the cable car, the restaurant at the bottom and the most impressive one is the Dive centre/ school there. The dive school is run by Carlos a very experienced diver where myself and my family went diving along with them. They provide a guided underwater diving which is at a very reasonable price compared to EU states  and saw groupers /  turtles / stingray  as a highlight .I never dived in a underwater area with volcanic rocks before and this is absolutely fascinating.
The quality of gear their had  was very good as well.

The park rises from the city centre with lovely views of the nearby harbour and sea. There are pretty flower displays throughout and at the top end is the picturesque lake with small water feature. There is also a cafe near to the lake with public toilets. 

It was a hot and sunny day when we visited and there were lots of people lieing around on the grass and sunbathing. We also passed a guide leading a tour around the park, so it can be quite busy in some areas. Lots of seating throughout to relax and quieter spots to find to enjoy the tranquillity, we sat on a bench overlooking the lake. Open from 7am to 9pm.

We paid €68 for all cable car rides, plus garden entry.

Boarding at Funchal you ride up the mountain to the first station. Here Monte Palace Tropical Garden is immediately to your left as you leave the station, and the walk to the cable car for Botanical Gardens is to the right, both are well sign posted.

Be aware that it is quite a long walk away - and all up a steep hill on the way back! I was heavily pregnant and just took it slowly. The hill is very steep but there are steps too. I think it took us about 15 minutes to walk from one cable car station to the other.

It was worth the walk for us, as the cable car ride to the Botanical Gardens was much more scenic, travelling across lush forests and countryside. It is just a couple of minutes journey on this cable car. 

We enjoyed our visit to the Botanical Gardens, but Monte Palace Tropical Gardens are a whole other level! and we highly recommend a visit.","A longer walk to the cable car station then expected, but worth it for the lovely views","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-02-25T23:43:08-05:00","4","After taking a cable car from Funchal to Monte Palace we took a second cable car to the Botanical gardens.First and second cable cars are very similar except for the views.

Bought family ticket at cable car station in Funchal to get to Monte and then catch the 2nd cable car to the botanical gardens - arrived at Monte the 2nd cable car was closed for maintenance.  It’s a 58 minute steep walk to the botanical gardens (not possible carrying child).  Staff at cable car station wouldn’t refund and neglected to tell us that the botanical gardens are actually accessible by car/taxi.  Therefore we wasted a full day and 54 euro on a cable car ride to Monte (which we had visited the day before). 

The only communication regarding the closure was a blank piece of paper. 

So be warned … check and triple check before you purchase a ticket and travel on the cable car hoping to catch the second cable car to the botanical gardens.  

We met many more disappointed people couldn’t do the walk and who didn’t make it to the botanical gardens that day. 

No mention of the closure on the website - and no communication. 

Botanical gardens (when we got there via taxi with road access (16 euro) on our last morning) before travelling home in the afternoon were wonderful (but we only saw half).","Bought cable car tickets to Monte to catch 2nd cable car to Botanical gardens -  after paying 54 euro found it closed","2023-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1","0","0","2","0","2","0","5","2018-01-31T10:41:25-0500","Tessa","B","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.9C912A553DF9BD5CF401EB47BD106279","en_UK","0","Tessa B","0",,"user","9C912A553DF9BD5CF401EB47BD106279","186430","Bangor, United Kingdom","Tessa B","en","false","2023-01-06T06:43:04-05:00","4","Smashing views and beautiful gardens and plenty of time to look around the botanical of lovely flowers and unusual trees as well as butterflies and lizards on side of low walls fascinate the grandchildren.

The trip to Ribeiro is exciting as the road is well maintained but you are climbing and awful long way just to come back down some. I think it's about 1200-1300 above sea level but the road has many tight bends and switchbacks and it is real fun to drive.
Anyway parking in Ribeiro is quite difficult as cars take one side of the road and force traffic down the other or you can park at the top of the hill and walk in. If you do, you pass a trout farm with free access and an interesting area to spend 15 minutes. A couple of souvenir shops and places to eat and just around the next corner is the Levada walk. Through dappled sunlight the walk is easy and on fairly solid ground. The walk to Balcoes is 1.5km and they suggest 1hr 45 on the board. personally we took it a lot slower than that and spent a long time at the viewpoint wishing the clouds to move away from the mountain peaks to get that dramatic photo. Unfortunately after a hour of waiting it was obvious that the wind was not going to play ball and so we made our way back.
The way is probably good enough for a motorised wheelchair although their are some steps as you make your final approach and there are some sections that go through the middle of sheer rocks and so it would depend on width.
The views from the Balcoes down to the sea are lovely and the mountains all around you do give a feeling of vastness. Also there are a lot of birds that come for food once the place clears of large numbers and we took many pictures.
My advice is to take your time rather than rushing. We spent a wonderful three hours doing this trip and felt refreshed for it.
There is also a cafe half way along selling drinks, snacks and some souvenirs.","Ribeiro Frio Levada Walk to Balcoes","2015-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","192","0","132","58","216","210","0","460","2010-04-14T10:05:11-0400","Steve","S","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.64D3DD30BA2D07C6E117FD8B739499F3","en_UK","0","Steve S","0",,"user","64D3DD30BA2D07C6E117FD8B739499F3","190764","Warrington, United Kingdom","Steve S","57","Nature & Parks",,,,,"#41 of 446 things to do in Madeira","57","Forests","68","Nature & Wildlife Areas",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/animal-welfare-education-portal/","Learn more","Click below for expert advice on animal welfare in tourism.","This attraction features animals","Features Animals",,,"Atlantic/Madeira","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189166-d670281-Reviews-Laurissilva_Forest-Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html","http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/934","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189166-d670281-Laurissilva_Forest-Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

This small village with rebuilt ""traditional"" houses was part of our ""Madeira East"" group tour.

It reminds me of a kind of artificial mini-amusement attraction for children. Not interesting at all for adults, not historic, just ""kitsch"" to attract tourists. (At least free entry). In the triangular houses plenty of awful and overpriced souvenirs are sold.

Not worth to visit.

Afterwards we enjoyed the fun touristy toboggan ride, before getting the cable car back down to Funchal and having a walk along the promenade by the sea. A very busy and fun day! The highlight was definitely the Monte Palace Tropical Gardens for us, so in comparison these gardens disappointed.

The Botanical Gardens are more open and formal than those at Monte Palace. One of their most famous features is the patterns in their borders made from plants, spelling out their name and the year. We enjoyed walking around in the sunshine, the paths are mostly good but uneven and narrow in some areas. In April there wasn't that many flowers to see. 

These gardens reminded me more of a really nice park from back home in the UK. Spread out across a large area and on a steepish hill, you will need to be relatively fit to get around all of the garden/park, I was heavily pregnant but just took it slowly.

We bought tickets at the cable car station in Funchal to include a visit to The Botanical Gardens. We paid €68 for all cable car rides, plus garden entry. 

Boarding at Funchal you ride up the mountain to the first station. Here Monte Palace Tropical Garden is immediately to your left as you leave the station, and the walk to the cable car for Botanical Gardens is to the right, both are well sign posted.

Be aware that it is quite a long walk away - and all up a steep hill on the way back! I was heavily pregnant and just took it slowly. The hill is very steep but there are steps too. I think it took us about 15 minutes to walk from one cable car station to the other.

It was worth the walk for us, as the cable car ride to the Botanical Gardens was much moew scenic, travelling across lush forests and countryside. It is just a couple of minutes journey on this cable car. 

We enjoyed our visit to the Botanical Gardens, but Monte Palace Tropical Gardens are a whole other level! Whilst the gardens aren't amazing, I would recommend seeing as you are already so close when visiting Monte Palace (a must see!) and it does all combine together to make a wonderful action-packed touristy day.","Reminded me more of a really nice park than a garden, but so close to other great activities you may as well visit","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-03-03T04:13:47-05:00","1","Do not bother.

The Botanical Gardens are scruffy, full of weeds, in need of attention throughout, clearly unloved and completely unattended by any staff.

The checkerboard beds - the iconic photo so many of us see - are half dead and festooned with weeds.
The topiary section - also an iconic photo opp - were in need of a really good trim.
The cactus area was awful - lots of brown/dead plants and so much graffiti scratched into the cactus fruits - if staff had been on site, maybe this behavior by visitors could have been averted.

After our sojourn we spoke with some other visitors who had similar views but put their disappointment down to visiting during a low season and a couple of months too early for some of the botanical collection to be showing its best.
That may be so, but having visited Monte Palace Gardens at the same time last year, their displays provided a much richer and vibrant experience.
The museum near the entrance is tired and uninteresting, and in some ways a bit creepy with its displays of older taxidermy specimens.
Another disappointment during this visit was that the bird collection was off-limits, with no official explanation why.
The only saving grace was that it did not cost a lot to enter, at €7.50 per adult.","Not quite showing its best in February...","2023-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg","28","0","0","33","68","74","0","135","2016-06-02T13:22:39-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D83CB437E3D5725A9184487A0ACF6B2A","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","D83CB437E3D5725A9184487A0ACF6B2A","-1",,"Parkrunner71","en","false","2023-02-20T05:08:44-05:00","2","Not the garden we thought we were visiting and don’t loose your ticket!!

We brought a ticket for the cable car (return) and entry to botanical gardens for 35 euro’s each. We asked if this was the gardens with flamingo and told yes it was……. No it isn’t! That would be the tropical gardens which would cost us another 12 euros each! 

So to try and make the best of the situation we headed down to the next cable car and to the gardens. When we arrived frankly it was nothing interesting. If you like plants and seeing how they have imported various species to the canneries fine. Toilets have not seats and honestly the gate attendant are unhelpful and not friendly at all! 

They removed our tickets which had been stapled together and then Didn’t return them all resulting in us having to pay for yet another ticket to get back to monte. 9 euros. The shops are nothing but tourist tat and if you are not good at hill walking just don’t bother! Steep, poorly layer out and very little to see or peek interest.

If so, you may find the botanical gardens a little underwhelming by comparison to Monte. If you only choose one of the gardens to visit, choose Monte. If you do wish to do them both, you can comfortably do them in a single day. 

We took the cable car from Monte down to the botanic gardens and back which was convenient, if a little expensive. Entrance to the gardens is cheap enough, so maybe get the bus rather than the cable car. There may also be a combination ticket available for the cable car from Funchal to Monte then from Monte to the botanic garden (they are two separate cable car routes from different sites) which could reduce costs, but we didn’t explore that option.","Visiting the same day as Monte made these feel underwhelming","2023-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","12","0","4","8","43","5","0","25","2012-06-25T16:20:39-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.3019C8959B05EE0F1B825B8AA7E60900","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","3019C8959B05EE0F1B825B8AA7E60900","580428","Runcorn, United Kingdom","LS899","en","false","2023-02-14T08:40:25-05:00","5","You can take bus 31 from the center to the Botanical Gardens @ 1.95 euro pp. Entrance in the garden is 7.50 euro pp, cash only.

We came to see the coffin of Emperor Karl I who had died in Funchal of Spanish Flu in 1922 after choosing to be exiled in this town after WWI when his Austrian-Hungarian Empire was dissolved in 1918. This year is the 100th anniversary of the king’s death and the church was celebrating it in different ways with events noted on an oversized poster at the church entrance, beside the bronze statue of the Emperor. 

Inside the church, the coffin is on the left hand side of the church and is placed in a side room.  On one wall, the king’s youthful portrait was hung, in the middle was his coffin, and to the right of the coffin were objects to show his once kingly status. The gilt crown on top of his dark coffin, without the jewels, of course, is a copy of the coronation crown called, Crown of St. Wenzelos, as explained by a bronze plaque placed beside the coffin. In front of the coffin there was a special wreath with the number 100 filled out in yellow flowers. At the main altar, 10 large white floral tributes were placed at the church’s main altar and a similar number beside the coffin.  What a wonderful display of flowers! 

The small church itself was unremarkable, but I was, indeed, surprised with the amount of gilt used to frame the paintings and the surrounding architectural features behind the main altar. Above the main altar on the ceiling was an inspirational, cheerful painting done in a style popular in the 19th century, while the rest of the ceiling was wooden.  

This church is close to the toboggan rides and the cable car ride – perhaps one way to reach Monte hill to see these attractions, but effortless with a cruise ship excursion.

It is worth trying as the church is very pretty & it was interesting to find our about the history of Charles 1st the last Austrian emperor who is buried there & who lived in exile in Madeira.

This proved most enjoyable (Review to follow) - particularly as our outward journey to Monte was around 0930 which not only meant missing the long ticket queues but meant there were relatively people in Monte itself. This was particularly so at the nearby Church of our Lady which - unlike our previous visit in May 2019 when there was a Graduation Ceremony taking place - we almost had to ourselves.

The only disappointment was the Church being closed so we weren’t able to see inside.

One of the main attractions in Monte is this 18th century Church which was completed in 1748. 

The name of the Church translates as Our Lady of Monte, who is the Patron Saint of Madeira. In 1818 it was inaugurated in her honour. 

The Feast day of Our Lady of Monte is celebrated each year on the 15th August. 

We climbed the 68 steps up to the Church. On a courtyard/landing area, between the 2 flight of steps, stands the Statue of Emperor Charles I of Austria. 

One of the features inside the Church is the coffin of Charles I of Austria in one if the altars along the side walls of the Church 

As we entered the Church we were certainly not expecting what we saw. Normally can always find something to say, in this instance lost for words, it has to be seen to be believed. 

The main altar is ornate, elaborate with its pillars, golden sculpted surround and painted religious images. 

Everything about here is spectacular, took our breath away. 

The walls are adorned with large paintings of religious imagery.

Very boring old style exhibition! You see plenty of trophies.... but no attractive explanations about CR7's life, like family etc

And the only interactive stop is only a cash machine!! You are not allowed to take a picture (only in this place forbidden, elsewhere ok). The ""museum"" wants to sell you a picture made by them for 5 Euro!

What was really shocking was the awful ""souvenir shop"" where they sold alcohol!? Madeirawine with CR7 name and publicity! Well well... can't understand this as CR7 is against alcohol ....

In front of the museum entrance you can take a picture for free with CR7 statue (in fact, sadly, it looks more like a King Kong statue 🙈)

If you go to Madeira and you are a football fan, even if you're not a fan of Ronaldo, this museum is still a must see. As the home of Ronaldo this museum takes on a different meaning with all the good things Ronaldo has done for the Portuguese people. All proceeds from the museum go toward charities (except the salaries of the staff and operating costs). The displays are interesting and the championship trophies and awards given to Ronaldo and his teams can only be seen here.

They’re all unique and very colourful, I've included photos of a few of my favourites. They are a hundred or more different ones to find, some down side alleys and just off the main street. You can easily explore for half an hour or more, before stopping to enjoy a meal at one of the many restaurants you'll find along the way.

There are many many restaurants here in old town (reviewed separately). We enjoyed all our meals especially at Basmati Indian restaurant. Most of the street is pedestrianised and some restaurants are set up outside right in the middle of the street, so it can get a little crowded in these places where the street becomes much more narrow.

We visited on 2 separate occasions; earlier on the morning is much quieter, before the restaurants open up, but later on there is more atmosphere if it does get a little too crowded.

It is reputed to have been designed And built Built by Architect Pedro Enes and Master Mason Gil Anes. who Built The Cathedral in Funchal.

This is a beautifully Ornate Church ,very peaceful and well worth a visit.
The people of Madeira are very Religious and when Mass is celebrated the Church is Full, standing room only'
About 4 years ago we attended a service where our Madeiran friends celebrated their Golden Wedding and renewed their vows with their large Family in attendance It was a Moving Ceremony and one we will always remember..

During World War II, production and sales had ground to a virtual halt. As a result, far more companies were leaving the business than were joining. But Mario Barbeito had faith in the future. He also believed that the value of great Madeira could only go up as it became older and production of young vintages declined. But while Barbeito saw those vintage wines as a nest egg for the future, he was content to let the wines age. He wisely built the business in the early years around more modest Madeiras. It was left to his daughter Manuela - when she gradually took over the business from him in the 1970s to continue his work. In the mid 1990s, Manuela Barbeito began to turn over the reins of the company to her son Ricardo Freitas. He not only brought a deep respect for Madeira's classical roots, but also brought new energy and new ideas to the company. One of these ideas was to restore the role that Madeira once had as a companion of food. Ricardo is continuing his grandfather's and mother's legacy of making wines and preserving them for future generations. But he is also creating his own legacy: a series of Madeiras he calls his ""Signature"" wines. These handcrafted wines combine the best elements of Madeira's classical tradition with Ricardo's own quest for purity and vineyard and varietal expression. Made in tiny lots, their astonishingly graceful style has prompted British wine critic Jancis Robinson to call Barbeito the ""Lafite of Madeira"".",,,"eu.portugal.madeira","info@vinhosbarbeito.com.pt","Atlantic/Madeira",,,,,"780","540","1050","840","780","540","1050","840","780","540","1050","840","780","540","1050","840","780","540","1050","840",,,,,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/08/2c/af/02/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","false","false","false","false","32.667828","8368222","Camara De Lobos, Madeira, Madeira Islands","none","-16.997839","Barbeito Madeira","153",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Closed Now","Camara De Lobos","+351 291 761 829","We are waiting for you, in our winery, for a tour and wine tasting.

If you are looking for something more unusual than the big commercial providers this establishment is definitely worth visiting. We climbed the hill on a hot afternoon to be greeted kindly by our considerate and very knowledgeable host Leander. Even though there was just the two of us Leander showed us all the areas of the process of making Madeira wine with the history and technicalities of the grapes and the complicated ageing process. At the end of the tour we were offered a choice of a free tasting of two wines, 5 wines including a 50 year old for 10 euros or 8 wines for 20 euros. Leandro took us through 5 very different wines with full explanations. Then we were left to make our choice of purchase from a very reasonable range of prices. It was very good of him to put the same energy in to a tour for just us as a big group. Many thanks for a memorable afternoon.","Well worth a visit","2020-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","3","0","0","0","0","2","0","5","2015-10-03T16:23:15-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.54E8D9EB84112B7DF9847E1BE8C80CF7","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","54E8D9EB84112B7DF9847E1BE8C80CF7",,,"GlobeTrotting601742","en","false","2020-02-16T05:38:05-05:00","5","We absolutely loved our tour at Barbeito!

We went by location and tripadvisor rating and therefore Barbeito was a no brainer. We booked a tour via email and with a little trouble found the place the next day. Weather was beautiful and the location is fantastic with great views over the fishing village of Camare de Lobos. The host was great, knowledgeable, spoke great English and had the perfect attitude wanting us to get to now all different types of Madeira wine. The place itself is very modern. Even though they have some old barrels, you won't see any old timber roofed buildings here. The great smell is there though ;) 
After the tour you get to the tasting part. You get to try 10 madeira wines, young ones and older ones so it gives you a good cross section, along with a good desctiption and some history.
As an added thing if you buy madeira wine for more than 25€ you do not have to pay for the tour, which we did and took a nice bottle back home for Christmas.
We can only recommend it. You need a car to get there though.","excellent madeira tour and tasting","2019-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/f4/12/45/molael.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/f4/12/45/molael.jpg","6","0","1","1","0","4","0","11","2014-11-25T04:24:14-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.51BA70B03385B7DBE2EE1662FDF0ABEC","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","51BA70B03385B7DBE2EE1662FDF0ABEC","186216","United Kingdom","Molael","en","false","2019-11-25T06:50:26-05:00","5","A brilliant tour and wine tasting.

This review is for the Center of Volcanism only.
Second: this is my impression from a visit with my wife and no kids. If you're planning a family visit, the experience might be different.
We visited the Center on a Friday. One of its staff ladies informed us that the caves were closed (which we already knew) and suggested that we can visit only the Center itself if we want for 5€ per person. IncIdentally, there was a guided tour coming up, so we quickly bought the tickets and went down the path to the center.
Let me tell you this: the ""guided tour"" was a letdown. All the guide did was press some buttons for some ""effects"" (such as an eruption demo, or a movie) to start and showed us the way from one attraction to the other. To us, a tour like that just seemed awkward. And the attractions like designed and made in the nineties.
1. The volcano eruption demo: ok, but no explanation of what is happening followed. There are informational posters on the first room, which probably explain all that, but I didn't have enough time to read them all, and my wife was unwilling to come back after the tour so I could finish reading them.
2. About Madeira movie: okay, but it felt pretty much like a VHS being played on an old TV. Also, reading the English subtitles and watching the film felt rather difficult sometimes.
3. The ""earth core"" room was okay, but again, not much explanation of why we're supposed to stare at it for a few minutes. Well, at least the mirrored mirrors was somewhat fun.
4. The 3D movie was... I don't know... Crap? One of the reasons: my glasses were apparently working the wrong way and I had to put them upside down for the 3D view to normalize. The film itself looked like an intermission in a nineties TV show for kids.

Along the way we saw a sign for the caves ""Grutas"" and we thought let's give it a go. 

We followed the signs to the Grutas and parked up in the car park and walked towards the caves. We took the pathway under the road which led us to the entrance gate to the gardens where the caves are located. 

We followed the signs for the ticket office and climbed up the numerous steps only to find at the top that it was all cordoned off and ticket office closed due to COVID. There were no signs at the bottom to say the caves were closed. 

We should have realised that something was a foot as all the small souvenir and photo kiosks, in the gardens were shut. Having said that there were gardeners tending to the gardens. 

It was possible to walk around the well maintained gardens.","Closed due COVID","2021-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/41/f8/1b/david-d.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/41/f8/1b/david-d.jpg","3020","0","176","180","1966","1056","0","4257","2013-12-20T10:47:05-0500","David","D","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.35E393ABB1BD1F36AA149B7150B6D498","en_UK","0","David D","0",,"user","35E393ABB1BD1F36AA149B7150B6D498","186250","Devon, United Kingdom","David D","en","false","2020-11-13T07:24:40-05:00","3","Was there in August 2019.

This means if you are booked on a tour you have no option but to go along because technically the centre is open.
OK I except Funchal did suffer a 5.1 earthquake on Saturday. Minimal damage to was seen in the form of rock slides on a few high roads on the south side of the island on Sunday, but safety is important. However please warn people especially tour operators that you are closed.

So as you guess this is about the 3D movie and journey to the centre of the world experience rather than the caves. So for you get the idea think of a B rate 1970s SciFi production and you may be close (except here you can see the mirrors). Add several groups being herded into several small spaces, starting the show before all the guests are inplace, no time given to read the information and the worse 3D production I have ever seen and you will be closer.

We had also seen an interesting film about the caves before we left for our trip. They are situated at the bottom of Sao Vicente town and there is a specified parking area which can be tricky to get a space in. The entrance cost is £8 euros each. Unfortunately the cave tour was underwhelming and probably lasts only around 30 minutes and then you are taken into a theatre type room to ‘experience’ what it would have been like in a volcanic eruption. A lot of the time we were waiting for our guide to explain in other languages, which in itself is ok, but this waiting around just added to the tediousness of the experience. On our visit part of the cave was also closed off for repairs meaning we had to return to the entrance we started at rather than going through the entire cave. They didn’t tell us that bit until we were half way through the cave! 
One really concerning thing was that they did not pre warn at the start that there would be intense flashing lights in the theatre feature. For those suffering from epilepsy, this is definitely a real problem!
We were also herded into a makeshift lift (about 30 of us) in which the whole thing started to shake for about 60 seconds. Any one with clostraphobic tendencies could easily panic at this point! 
Overall the experience was not fantastic and we were quite disappointed after having looked forward to our visit. We certainly wouldn’t go back again and wouldn’t recommend anyone to make a special trip there unless you just happen to be in Sao Vicente already. Not really value for money.","Underwhelming underground experience ","2020-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","9","0","0","21","10","27","0","57","2015-10-06T16:29:06-0400","Ed","N","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.594B9956D30C59F3C67384D6DEEE606A","en_UK","0","Ed N","0",,"user","594B9956D30C59F3C67384D6DEEE606A","186250","Devon, United Kingdom","Ed N","en","false","2020-02-19T03:05:16-05:00","4","This tour has two parts, the trip into the lava tubes (caves), and the information/3D experience afterwards.

Fatimy na Pico da Cova. Po drodze zajrzałem do zamkniętych jaskiń a póżniej stopniowo wspinałem się na wzgórze z kaplicą . Z dołu wydawała się bardzo odległa i położona bardzo wysoko. W rzeczywistości idąc krętymi ścieżkami na wzgórze nie czułem ,że idę jakoś bardzo wysoko . Po wejściu na wzgórze widać ,że góruje ono nad całą okolicą .Stojąc pod kaplicą mamy piękny widok na całą dolinę i Sao Vicente aż po Atlantyk . Nawet tylko dla tych widoków warto się wspinać pod samą kaplicę . Kaplica jest trochę zaniedbana a przez oszklone ale zamknięte drzwi widać wnętrze kaplicy z niedużym ołtarzem . Można schodzić tą samą trasą . Ja wracałem bardziej urozmaiconą i trochę dziką  Levadą  dos Cardais . Po drodze był punkt widokowy Miraduro dos Cardais z pięknym widokiem na Atlantyk i zabudowania Sao Vicente. Po drodze miałem jeszcze kolejny punkt widokowy przy Praceta dos Cardais z widokiem na Atlantyk na wyciągnięcie ręki . Wszędzie dookoła było dużo bujnej zieleni ale także bardzo dużo winnic . Urokliwe i spokojne miejsca a po drodze nie spotkałem ani jednej osoby . Tylko kontakt z przyrodą w towarzystwie śpiewających ptaków i czasem szumu wody w lawadzie .

I took 3 private lessons from Iisa and that was definitely the highlight of my 2 week holiday in Madeira.
Iisa is a very professional instructor. She is very patient, supportive and clearly enjoys her job.
What made me very happy was that the horses were very well taken care of, the stable and the surroundings were clean.

The people who running Madeira Equestrian Club is friendly, welcoming, professional and they all shared a passion for horses (mainly Lusitanos 😊). They offer a personal riding experience to everyone, even if you are a beginner or an advanced rider (you find all detailed information at the website). The horses are in very good condition, well trained and the instructors are the best practising classic Portuguese dressage. I just wish that I could have stayed longer and just spent my days at the stable, riding, have a good chat in the coffee room and just hang out with this absolutely amazing horses (and people of course!) 

I will come back!!! 💕💕

As complete novices when it comes to horse riding we booked an introduction session with Isa. Each of my children (ages 4,7,14), had a one to one introduction helping to build confidence with the horse as well has how to sit properly etc. Isa took it slowly and encouraged my children to feel confident to hold on with one hand (4 year old), trot (7 year old) and canter (14 year old). I then had a go myself (I am not sporty!). Isa was encouraging, kind and firm which made us feel confident about trying new things.  We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, my children are really keen to go back and get back on a horse when we are back, they loved Isa too.

Either you follow the levada do Alecrim, or you go way down to lagao do Vento. We´ve chosen the way down, and it was worth it! It´s a lot of stairs to go all the way down. But what you see is one of the most amazing places in Madeira. It is like a fantasy spot... 

The way back you can choose to go back up or take the path to the rabacal house.

O percurso começa no Rabaçal, mas na parte de cima, não é preciso descer até à casa, basta encontrar a Levada do Alecrim (que também não está assinalada) facilmente identificável à direita do portão da carrinha que faz o transporte até à casa do Rabaçal. A partir daí o percurso é plano e encontra-se em bom estado até que a cerca dos 2km existe uma entrada à esquerda do percurso (não assinalada, mas visível por ser larga e ter degraus) em que começa a descida com cerca de 1km e 200m de diferença de altitude, o que torna o percurso difícil, principalmente na subida, não porque o acesso esteja em mau estado, mas devido à inclinação acentuada, que para uma pessoa com capacidade física normal é acessível, pode é demorar mais ou menos tempo a ser feito. A cascata tem uma altura vertiginosa e é visível durante a descida, assim como a lagoa também é bastante bonita, com diversos tons de verde, azul e vermelho, parecendo ser um local ideal para um mergulho no verão (em dezembro não arriscamos o frio). Após a subida recomendo continuar a levada do Alecrim até à próxima cascata que fica a cerca de 1km, mas num percurso muito mais fácil e plano e com uma cascata diferente, menor em altura, mais larga e com outros efeitos, também propícia a um banho (no verão).
Assim, para fazer a lagoa do vento e a levada do alecrim (ida e volta) são cerca de 8km, enquanto para a lagoa do vento são 6km, num percurso que prima pela grande cascata e pela menor popularidade em relação a outros percursos no rabaçal, como a própria levada do alecrim, a levada das 25 fontes ou a boca do risco.","Uma caminhada escondida com direito a cascata","2017-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","3","0","0","0","0","2","0","5","2016-02-20T15:21:06-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.96169CC5C20D6880E0D77E30B52AA797","pt","0",,"0",,"user","96169CC5C20D6880E0D77E30B52AA797","652086","Torres Novas, Portugal","helder36","pt","false","2017-10-28T06:49:56-04:00","5","Um dos melhores lugares da ilha da Madeira!

Ik heb de route die wij gebruikt hebben bijgevoegd als afbeelding. Ik beveel aan hem tegen de klok in te lopen, dan begin je met het pittigste en eindig je met het gemakkelijke stuk langs de levada (extra voordeel is dat je dan later bij de levada bent en het dus niet zo druk is). Het eerste stuk, vanaf het startpunt (midden onderin) tegen de klok in naar het Rabacal house (tweede groene POI marker) zou ik niet aanraden, dat is enorm overgroeid. Wij zijn in plaats daarvan de asfaltweg afgelopen tot je bijna bij Rabacal house bent, en dan kruis je op gegeven moment weer de route van deze hike (GPS aanbevolen!! Wij gebruikten de ""WalkMe"" app die 5 euro kost). Verder hebben wij wel de hele route gevolgd. (dit weet ik omdat we de eerste dag niet goed gekeken hadden en daarom per ongeluk de asfaltweg afgelopen waren, de tweede dag hebben we het overgeslagen stuk alsnog gelopen maar dat viel dus tegen).

Zo'n beetje de hele route behalve het laatste stuk (vanaf na de laatste POI marker op de kaart) zijn wij niemand tegengekomen wat heerlijk was. De hele route is pittig, nergens verhard en relatief veel klimmen en dalen, maar wel goed te doen. Ik zou onszelf als gemiddeld sportief omschrijven en dat was genoeg. De lagoa do vento is een prachtige plek voor een picnic en een duik. Als je om het meertje heen klautert naar de overkant van waar je aankomt zit daar een stuk waar veel minder algen groeien.

Na de derde POI komt de route uit op een levada, als je dat leuk vindt kan je die nog weer omhoog volgen naar een bronnetje/watervalletje. Bij de levada kom je ook weer mensen tegen.","Pittige hike over onverharde paden","2016-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","2","0","0","1","0","1","0","4","2016-09-21T05:52:00-0400","Pieter-Paul","K","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.77455893DC829597D9C1092AAAB4CBAB","nl","0","Pieter-Paul K","0",,"user","77455893DC829597D9C1092AAAB4CBAB",,,"Pieter-Paul K","ru","false","2016-06-25T08:56:29-04:00","4","Достаточно впечатляющий маршрут с красивыми видами и достаточно крутыми участками.

Teixeira is an easy drive up mainly good roads from near Santana. The route up to the summit is almost entirely stone-paved and it's an easy and wide path with gentle gradients but some very dramatic views to both sides, particularly if the clouds are coming and going as they often do up in the mountains., and the views from the  summit itself, in every direction, are truly stunning. There's even a government rest house just a few hundred metres from the summit for further refreshments if you need them, with a large sheltered terrace outside as well as seats inside. And from the summit or just below it there are also some much more challenging and rougher routes both west (to Encumeada) and south (to Pico Ariero) though both take 4-5 hours one-way and are not for the faint-hearted or those who suffer from vertigo..!

The scenery changes initially to what resembles the new forest. Odd I know. Gorse heathland with cows and cattle grids but with valleys with clouds in them. You gradually rise and the scenery changes to deep green valleys with blue seas beyond up to peaks of stone and even better views. It doesn't matter where you look, where you take a picture or video.

Located in São Vicente, it covers an area close to 12,000 square meters and it´s the perfect place to enjoy the local scenic beauty. The visitor can find two limestone quarries, a lime kiln and a lime house, and other constructions to support agriculture and livestock, such as a hayloft, an irrigation well and a transport cable. The path that passes through the museum centre maintains its old configuration and allows one to appreciate all the beauties that this place has to offer. This area is unique on Madeira, because it´s the only place where marine limestones can be found, as well as several types of marine fossils (some as old as 7 million years). In the lime house there´s a permanent exhibition and a video which explains the transformation of limestone into lime.

Das waren 30 Minuten Privatführung und wir waren sehr dankbar dafür. Die Entstehungsgeschichte und auch die Informationen wie der Betrieb gelaufen sein muss, war hochinteressant. Auch landschaftlich ist es sehr schön. Inmitten der Berge muss man weniger hundert Meter gehen um dann über eine Treppe zum Kalkofen und dem Museum zu gelangen.

We stopped at this Mirador which is located in the northern part of the Peninsula. 

We parked up in the small car park area and went walking about. There is a viewing area,  with hand rails, to stand and admire the views. For those more intrepid visitors there were pathways, with no rails, further along the headland. The reward for their bravery was even more fantastic views. 

We could see the outline of Porto Santo in the distance 

This was definitely not for the faint hearted especially on a wild, wet and windy day like today. Would definitely recommend bringing a jacket with you, just in case. Having said that there were people walking around in vests and shorts.","Wet, wild and windy with great views","2021-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/41/f8/1b/david-d.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/41/f8/1b/david-d.jpg","3020","0","176","180","1966","1056","0","4257","2013-12-20T10:47:05-0500","David","D","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.35E393ABB1BD1F36AA149B7150B6D498","en_UK","0","David D","0",,"user","35E393ABB1BD1F36AA149B7150B6D498","186250","Devon, United Kingdom","David D","en","false","2021-07-10T13:07:41-04:00","4","Nice coastal view of the east part of the island.

It is well worth the effort!

Pull the old fashioned bell pull to gain admittance. Although you can enter the church without paying, it is definitely worth the €2 to join a conducted tour of the monastery. Tours are in English. This takes you along corridors around the cloisters and into small chapels used by the nuns as well as the nun’s choir, where the nuns could watch mass taking place in the main church. There are two wonderful oratories behind wooden doors - look out for the delightful picture of the cockerel on the big one. 

Tours are run continuously and it is possible to join one without having to wait. 

Remember it is shut from 12-3, so plan a visit round these times. Allow 30-60 minutes to visit.","A fascinating visit","2019-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","272","0","3","22","128","31","0","325","2014-08-29T04:22:12-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.DE8BF4B04F854245B66A6ED8C120EFC8","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","DE8BF4B04F854245B66A6ED8C120EFC8","186335","Lincolnshire, United Kingdom","EESW1","47","Sights & Landmarks",,,,,"#33 of 446 things to do in Madeira","175","Churches & Cathedrals","17","Historic Sites",,,,,,,,,,"Atlantic/Madeira","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189167-d546183-Reviews-Santa_Clara_Convent-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html",,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189167-d546183-Santa_Clara_Convent-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

Me and my girlfriend started at Lamaceiros at noon. Weather was nice and in the first three hours we passed some tremendous lookouts, waterfalls and laurel trees. The tunnels by then had been narrow and streaked with puddles – more or less. Anyways, none of them required much effort or more than five minutes of walking. At some point, we reached a tunnel we could barely look through. As I learned later this was the one with a remarkable length of sheer 1,5 km. It would seem the thing to turn back here, or – for the ones who love the tunnels – to pass it and go back through right after. On our way through the tunnel we helped ourselves with phone flashlights
and got little wet passing the waterfalls in the middle.
We went on, lead by the false assumption there would come a junction for the road soon. Also, we weren't eager to go back for it had been quite a walk till there and getting darker. Few short tunnels followed, with the very last of them being extraordinarily muddy. The way became worse evermore, eventually – after five hours of walking –leaving us surprised at its southern deadlock.
After a brief discussion we figured it would be unreasonable to proceed walking up the brook there. Going back the same way daylight was about to fade. We increased our paces, running wherever possible. Passing the tunnels this time we didn't give a monkeys about dirty shoes. Our phones batteries had run low and we wanted to save it for the remaining tunnels. We were grateful for each wire fence to cling to so that we could walk on quicker (the Levada runs along the scarp). Luckily the full moon had risen soon to lighten the way and we were looking forward to each obstacle to come.

Certainly, our thrill to hike was just as big as our naivety.
In any case, you'd be better off with torches and waterproof clothes.","Unique walking past tunnels and biodiversity","2018-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/15/e4/cb/24/fwiede.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/e4/cb/24/fwiede.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2018-12-26T08:26:18-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E70515ABA8F6F3658ACACC07C3DC4D60","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","E70515ABA8F6F3658ACACC07C3DC4D60",,,"fwiede","en","false","2018-09-10T09:33:14-04:00","5","With our friend we enjoyed such a lot in this wonderful area with sights and sounds - managed to gain another experience of Madeira well worth a vist","So much to see","2018-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","68","0","0","8","209","32","0","108","2016-12-10T16:38:57-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.3C682388FE5CCC97D84115DE4469F2BD","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","3C682388FE5CCC97D84115DE4469F2BD","186299","Southampton, United Kingdom","812foxy","en","false","2018-08-31T06:04:03-04:00","4","We walked the first 6 km.

There is a trout farm, a restaurant and a couple of quite touristy shops to mark the start.
The problem with these walks its that they are linear so you either do the walk and get a taxi back tho the start (expensive and time consuming) or you walk there and back (long) or you walk for as long as you want and then turn around (you miss out on stuff).
We did about 1 1/2 hours and then turned around so felt we had managed a good walk but a shame not to have completed it - next time we will start from the other end so we can say we have done it twice!
It is an easy walk with a few high narrow bits and some lovely views although you are walking in the cover of trees most of the time.
The trout farm is interesting but it is a shame there is no one there to tell you about it and no information as to what happens to all these fish. Trout does not appear to be common on many menus so no idea where they end up.
There were a lot of people (cars and coaches) around the restaurant and shop but once on the walk not many so I think a lot just come up for a look see but not to walk.
Gift shops sell a lot of woolen clothes as well as tourist tat.","Trout farm at the start of a levada walk","2018-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/97/avatar023.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/97/avatar023.jpg","58","0","29","56","73","156","0","270","2013-03-20T06:45:34-0400","Philip","S","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.77C16C375B363E648F82E5A0A02316E9","en_UK","0","Philip S","0",,"user","77C16C375B363E648F82E5A0A02316E9","191259","Greater London, United Kingdom","Philip S","en","false","2018-02-05T12:11:24-05:00","5","If you're looking for lush forests, impressive waterfalls and dingy tunnels then this walk is for you!

Recommendations:

1. Wear walking shoes, the more waterproof the better
2. Bring a torch, ideally one torch per person and even more ideally a head torch to leave your hands free to help you balance...
3. Be prepared to do a bit of balancing on the levada wall in the tunnels to avoid getting wet feet (either in the levada or the puddles alongside)
4. Our sat nav (google maps) tried to take us up a dodgy road (the caminho da ladeira) in Porto Moniz to the start of the walk. Our hire car ceouldn't do it, even in first gear! I would strongly recommend staying on the ER101 as long as possible before taking the road across to Lamaceiros
5. There are toilets, parking and picnic benches at the start of the walk in Lamaceiros
6. There's a hut halfway along which is a good place to stop for sandwiches. We continued past this through a couple of further tunnels before getting to a part of the levada which was overflowing where we turned back.
7. There's no public transport to the start of the walk so a hire car or tour is the best bet (otherwise you have to walk up from Porto Moniz which would be quite a trek)","Great walk","2018-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/77/69/4e/nombag.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/77/69/4e/nombag.jpg","55","0","67","4","9","104","0","163","2011-09-17T17:14:47-0400","g","m","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FD37DC2EF544FB8860E05507FB3CF55F","en_UK","0","g m","0",,"user","FD37DC2EF544FB8860E05507FB3CF55F","186220","Bristol, United Kingdom","g m","en","false","2017-12-28T09:32:30-05:00","5","Another of Madeira's fabulous levada walks.

It runs from Admiral Reis Garden to the east of the City to Rotunda Sá Carneiro, on the west side. It has the statue of Christiano Ronaldo at one end and a giant statue of a footballer at the other. 

It is an amazing Street with so much to see and do, it really does have it all. 

The historic walls of Palicio Sao Lourenco run along the Avenida. 

A number of small parks line the route, Praco do Provo, Praca do Autonomia, Jardins de Teleferico and Jardim do Almirante Reis. 

When we walked along here parts of the Avenida was a sea of blue and white  agapanthus flowers, which just happened to be my favourites. 

Also from here visitors catch the Teleferico Cable Car up to Monte and the Botanical Gardens. 

There are a plethora of statues, sculptures and memorials. Some are more recognisable than other, some are fun others have a more serious message. 

There are a number of fountains along the way as well, but as result of the COVID restrictions they were not working. 

Funchal Marina is also along the Avenida 

This is such an important National Street, that when we visited here on 9th June a stage was being erected as the focal point of the celebrations for Portugal Day, the next day on the 10th June.

There were plenty of seating for visitors to use, maybe give their weary feet a rest or simply just to sit and watch the world pass by.

You can be very easily ripped off, especially on the upper floor where the produce is much more expensive (approx. 3 times) than on the ground floor. It is nice to visit, have a look at the local produce and take some pictures. The vendors try to attract your attention while offering you some fruit to taste, however, the prices are extreme. We came with the intention to buy some fruit to take back home, which we eventually did, but paid 15 euros for 3 small maracujas and one medium size annona (custard apple).

Walk around, take some pictures, have a look at the fishmarket, go upstairs to see the rooftop café (also overpriced).

Plenty of places in beautiful Funchal where you better follow the locals and buy fruit, flowers.... for a correct price/quality ratio. (Supermarkets like continente are ok).

If you're fit and used to hill walking then don't use the bus or car and walk up - its a great trek. Otherwise, you'll need an ambulance at the midway point.

The view is spectacular across the island but obviously plan your trip with the weather in mind.

The walk was not hard for my teenagers and they got to peak in 1 hour and 15 mins. For us, we took about 1 hour and 35 mins.
After the shop/ cafe, the hike becomes more difficult but you can always stop and rest a bit and enjoy the views.
There is a toilet and you need to pay 50c and don’t forget your sun cream ! 
We didn’t drive nor join a tour, we hired a taxi driver and asked him to wait for us and on the way back we asked him to stop at other tourists places.

It is advisable to dress accordingly (it is windy and gets really freezing cold at the top), and not to be afraid of heights, as the way gets leather ""airy"". 

Is it worth it to go all the way up? Actually no, as the views after the first 500 meters up from the  parking Lot are the best. There is not not much of a change or an improvement if you climb further, it is rather a psychological thing = there are those who would go up anyway.

I went in December on a rainy day. The weather changed at 1000m altitude.  With clouds below, it was a nice view on a sea if white clouds.

This is my second review as I wanted to update my previous review in 2017 as there have been some changes. Unless you go on an organised trip you will need a car and although the route from Funchal is not obvious - we managed to use google maps to find it without too much difficulty. The drive from Funchal itself should take around an hour (depending on where you are staying) and you need to get on the main highway that takes you past the airport, then Machico and you need to get off after Porto da Cruz at a roundabout junction where there is a Continente supermarket (hopefully you will be able to spot it in advance providing you keep your eyes peeled). When you get off at the junction turn left and you should drive past the supermarket (which will be on your left) and keep going up hill - you are aiming for a car park at the Archado do Teixera -which should take you around 15-20 minutes.
The dirt car park is basically at the end of the road and is level and free. There are no toilets at the car park but they have now built a hotel with restaurant nearby where they charge 1€  to use their toilet (whether you use the restaurant or not!). The car park its surrounded by bushes and shrubbery and most hikers previously used this for cover if they need to relieve themselves - because after this there aren't so many opportunities. However, there are signs prohibiting this now - so they clearly expect you to now pay for the toilet! Its not a difficult walk being paved for most of the way making walking easy, but it is a climb (330m vertical ascent) so be prepared if you are not used to it. The trail splits towards the end where you need to go right which soon takes you past a white house where there are toilets (and you have to pay again I think) and you can also get refreshments here - plus there are now tables and chairs as they have refurbished the place from old. If you go left instead of right on the trail you are on a hard walk over to Pico do Ariero that currently involves steep climbs and descents and is a much more challenging prospect. From this point (the white house) its a short but quite hard climb to the top where there are three lookout points giving you great views on a clear day (make sure you keep left at the first junction you meet otherwise you will end up on another trail.

It took us around 3-4 hours with some stopping.

Would only recommend it if you have good visibility and if you go on the off chance be prepared for bad weather. When I was on an organised trip many years ago walking from Pico do Ariero over to Pico do Ruivo I was caught in lashing wind and rain on the way back to the start of this walk and despite all the right gear was literally frozen - and this was in October when everyone in Funchal was in shorts and sandals - so beware. [as a foot note to this warning - we returned a couple of days after our successful trip in October 2019 to be met with lashing rain as we entered the car park - so we turned around and drove to Canical to get some sunshine and dry weather!]","Best route to the top of Madeira","2019-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0f/8c/c3/44/jcm99.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/8c/c3/44/jcm99.jpg","46","0","5","25","25","43","0","114","2014-11-13T12:41:12-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E0AF86EAC340FAC482A3574A5A696F3D","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","E0AF86EAC340FAC482A3574A5A696F3D","1065351","Chinnor, United Kingdom","jcm99","en","false","2018-12-20T07:16:43-05:00","5","Stuning scenery and very steep heights.

When I was on an organised trip many years ago walking from Pico do Ariero over to Pico do Ruivo I was caught in lashing wind and rain on the way back to the start of this walk and despite all the right gear was literally frozen - and this was in October when everyone in Funchal was in shorts and sandals - so beware.","Easiest Route to the Top of Maderia","2017-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0f/8c/c3/44/jcm99.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/8c/c3/44/jcm99.jpg","46","0","5","25","25","43","0","114","2014-11-13T12:41:12-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E0AF86EAC340FAC482A3574A5A696F3D","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","E0AF86EAC340FAC482A3574A5A696F3D","1065351","Chinnor, United Kingdom","jcm99","en","false","2018-05-07T06:14:20-04:00","5","One of the best things I have saw in Madeira, the nature is so beautiful, lot of flowers ""above the clouds"".

First, you need to get there, by car (as we did, a one hour drive from Funchal) or there are various organised walks, with bus to the site included, by taxi and I think there may be a public bus. It is an interesting last 7km up the mountain, but the road is quite wide enough for two cars. The hydrangea hedges and other flora are spectacular on the way up (and down).

There is a good car park at the site which is level and free.

The walk starts easily enough and is paved for most of the way making walking easy, but it is a reasonable climb (330m vertical ascent) so a fair workout, but we saw all abilities make it to the top where the views are brilliant. There are three lookout points at the top which give you views to all four points.

There is a toilet about 2/3 the way up close to where the trail splits, but no refreshments so take everything you need with you.

We recommend an early (ish) start, we got there at 10:20 and by the time we were coming down 13:00) it was getting pretty busy. 

Because of the mix of abilities/fitness, there can be a couple of bottlenecks on the upper parts where it gets a bit narrow and steep, but everyone is good natured.

Routes 1 and 1.1 are also accessible from here and look exciting but we didn't have time that day.

Like all mountain trails, weather is key. There are shelters on the mountain but keep an eye and prepare accordingly (I know, grandmother and sucking eggs!!). It also is fully exposed so sun can be fierce.","Vereda do pico Ruivo (route PR1.2)","2017-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","14","0","37","6","0","4","0","24","2011-05-16T08:30:56-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6BEACD9D81353C0DE9B4FFF700933C4D","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","6BEACD9D81353C0DE9B4FFF700933C4D",,"Alton","smfletcher","pt","false","2023-04-07T03:58:54-04:00","5","Lugar incrivel.

The cathedral is free to enter and (like most cathedrals) even if you are not overly religious, you have to admire the sheer beauty of the decoration and construction. 

This cathedral dates back around 500 years but is virtually unchanged inside.

There is an immediate calm when entering the nave that is large but not vast. Quaint but not awe-inspiring. 

We visited on Easter Saturday with no suggestion  of a fee for entering. There cathedral is also a superb backdrop for those all important holiday snaps.

We spent hours walking around Old Town (Zona Velha) taking lots of photos and discovering hidden little places.

On Santa Maria Street nearly every other door is painted with a different design. They’re all unique and very colourful. They are a hundred or more different ones to find, some down side alleys and some on the main street. You can easily explore for half an hour or more, before stopping to enjoy a meal at one of the many restaurants you'll find along the way.

Many many restaurants here in old town (reviewed separately). We enjoyed all our meals especially at Basmati Indian restaurant. Most of the street is pedestrianised and some restaurants are set up outside right in the middle of the street, so it can get a little crowded in these places where the street becomes much more narrow. The cobble alleys at the back of the restaurants seemed very crowded to us, with people constantly squeezing past the packed tables, so we opted for restaurants that opened out onto the front, so we had more space and privacy.

We visited on 2 separate occasions, earlier on the morning is much quieter, before the restaurants open up, but later on there is more atmosphere if it does get a little too crowded.

Remember to try Bola de Caco everywhere you eat in Madeira! This is the local flatbread often served with meals. It is often covered in garlic butter - basically a flat garlic bread but sooooo good!

Zona Velha) is just  short couple of minutes walk from the seafront and the Avenida do Mar. The main bus stops and the cable car terminal is also just a couple of minutes walk away, so a very central location. There are public toilets near to the main bus stops.","lots of walking to explore the old town and the nearby seafront","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2023-02-24T04:40:47-05:00","4","Zona Velha is also known as the old town.

So on Wednesday 9th June we spent a couple of hours walking along the cobbled streets exploring and sightseeing 

The Old Town or Zona Velha stretches from the Mercardo de Lavradores (Farmers Market) as far as Fort of São Tiago ( Fort of Saint James). 

It was so enjoyable walking through the narrow streets lined with cafes, bars, restaurants, artisan and gift shops. Keep an eye out for the Duck Shop, a bit of fun. 

We thoroughly enjoyed visiting Capela do Corpo Santo and Igreja de Santiago Menor, two beautiful Churches. 

We did stop for a short rest and a beer or two at Tapas do Anibal, more local trade than tourists. 

One of the many highlights of Old Town is a walk down Rua Santa María to be amazed by the incredible street art. 

Nearby Praca do Autonomia are Forte Novo (Ruins). 

The Funchal to Monte Cable Car Station is also located in the Old Town. There are a number of statues and monuments dotted about the place.","So much to see and do - a definite must do","2021-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/41/f8/1b/david-d.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/41/f8/1b/david-d.jpg","3020","0","176","180","1966","1056","0","4257","2013-12-20T10:47:05-0500","David","D","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.35E393ABB1BD1F36AA149B7150B6D498","en_UK","0","David D","0",,"user","35E393ABB1BD1F36AA149B7150B6D498","186250","Devon, United Kingdom","David D","en","false","2021-06-07T12:02:47-04:00","4","Nice place with many pretty murals.

We purposely went slowly and it still only took us an hour and a half (plus an additional 15 minutes worth of stops). Of course there were people going much faster, in both directions. Good luck to them. We took the opportunity to look around us and enjoy the view, not just look at our footing the whole time.

Visibility was a bit hit and miss due to the low clouds passing over the mountains and it could change dramatically within minutes, indeed when we got there the view was clear and five minutes later the passing cloud had obscured most of the view...it cleared again shortly afterwards.

Also in the town you can find unique liquors from Madeira that are hard to get anywhere else.

I totally appreciate that times and attitudes have changed and you can’t judge the past by today’s standards, but I feel that the museum should have done more to acknowledge the barbarity and destructiveness of whaling.

The second stage of the museum about marine mammals and evolution is much more accessible and enlightening, but it was a distressing experience overall and we left feeling sickened frankly.","High level exhibits let down by not acknowledging destructiveness of whaling.","2022-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg","3","0","1","5","0","6","0","14","2013-09-29T03:45:32-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B31E1F4CED6D32A2209F0F4B46821A7E","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","B31E1F4CED6D32A2209F0F4B46821A7E","190745","Newbury, United Kingdom","8danib","en","false","2022-10-06T13:28:55-04:00","4","The museum gives a very realistic picture of the history of Madeira.

The permanent exhibition on whales with the different movies (you got your own headphones that pick up the relevant signal at every movie or exhibition item) and your 3D glasses, is done very well and insightful too.

As the title says - mixed feelings.

The museum is bright and airy with plenty of space.  There is free parking in the adjacent car park.  The whole site is disabled friendly with full access available.  The museum enjoys wondrous views, across the ocean towards the deserted islands (Las Ilhas Desertas)  This is a paid activity - see website for current admission costs - and as it is mainly inside, it would be very suitable for a rainy day.  All of the exhibits and displays have details in Portuguese (naturally) and also English (very helpful to many tourists) besides which there is an audio 'wand' included in the price of admission which guides you around in several languages.  Back in the day (and not that long ago either) Madeira had a whaling industry.  Canical, where the museum is situated, became the centre of this industry.  You can, if you look hard, see bits of architecture that are from this period in the history of the island.  There was a fascinating account of the, substantial, pressure exerted by tourists, for this industry to cease.  Many, many letters and postcards flooded in from across the globe - eventually resulting in the cessation of commercial whaling in Madeira.  Some of these are on display - don't think that small actions can have no results, this display proves otherwise.  The museum does not shy away from this subject (commercial whaling) and makes no apology for this part of Madeira's history.  Lets not forget that other countries participated in whaling too - Whitby (England) has a couple of whale jawbones making an archway overlooking the North Sea.  There are full size boats on display - imagining people setting sail in these small craft is quite frightening.  One swipe of a whales tail......... Its not just whales that the museum looks at, there are full size models of other marine life - giving a real feel for just how large some of them are.  We particularly enjoyed the interactive experience of going inside a craft which can  dive down to the ocean floor, looking at the creatures at various depths.  We learned why those black scabbard fish (Espada) are black.  Today, one of the problems that Madeira (and indeed the whole world) faces is pollution from plastics.  Right outside the museum is an artform made from waste plastic items encased by wire mesh, in the shape of a whale.  See photo.  Plastic waste in our seas and oceans is killing marine life.  There is a display listing just how long some items take to degrade in the sea - this was an eye opener too.  Just like those pioneering tourists (every postcard made a difference) YOU can do something to help this current plastic problem.  Reduce, reuse, recycle.  Please dispose of your waste plastic in an environmentally friendly manner.  There are several  topics within the museum and you could stay longer than the 1-2 hours suggested, although interest levels, particularly in younger children, would start to wane.  There's a nice cafe within the museum selling a range of items.  We took ours outside, since it was a nice day, onto terracing overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and reflected on some of the exhibits.

I must be honest and state that it was disappointing in the extreme. To describe this as world class is a bit of a joke. There are much better such museums in Norway and Hull Town Docks museum has a far better section on whaling with better exhibits and atmosphere. 
Basically it’s a huge building which must have cost millions of euros with very little in it.

The soundtrack could be selected manually or it would change automatically as you changed areas.
The museum explained the history of whaling in Madeira and how Caniçal became the main centre for the whaling industry on the island eventually building a whaling factory to process the catch.
With scale models, boats, whales, tools used in the industry it gave a fascinating insight into the whaling industry. Some of the film / video footage was quite barbaric showing the chase once the whales had been spotted, the harpoons being launched, and the whales being cut up back at the factory.
As someone who has seen sperm whales close up I found myself both admiring the bravery of the men who set out in small boats to capture the whale, and horrified at the way in which these magnificent animals were butchered at the end of the chase.
Thankfully whaling in Madeira stopped when it became unprofitable and now the story is told via the museum - definitely worth a visit - it will take approx 2 hours to complete the tour of the museum.","Very good museum - worth a visit","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/a0/28/14/telecaster428.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/a0/28/14/telecaster428.jpg","24","0","32","22","53","76","0","122","2011-08-29T09:22:22-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8A04465ACB380DC055CBF970DBDD5015","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","8A04465ACB380DC055CBF970DBDD5015","190729","Wakefield, United Kingdom","telecaster428","en","false","2019-09-05T09:11:43-04:00","5","Excellent for all the family.

I got dropped off at the starting point of the hike where there was a climb up to join the levada. Good to follow the signs carefully until you get on the right path. 

There are some up and down sections to start with but then it broadens out with wider paths and nice views. There were a few turns where it was helpful to have a map (or I found the WalkMe Madeira App helpful).

There was one tricky bit where there was either a practically non-existent crumbled path around a drop or a kind of narrow walkway across. I held my breath and went across the walkway! Apologies I didn't take a photo of that section. Apart from that it was a relatively gentle hike.

I got picked up from where the levada met the main road. I think you can go on further though.

A very enjoyable hike, and one which I felt comfortable doing alone (although after doing a couple of others with a guide and with good local advice for this one). Would love to do it again!","Tranquil walk, not too steep and narrow","2020-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0e/e4/09/3c/la-viajera-constanta.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0e/e4/09/3c/la-viajera-constanta.jpg","105","0","108","103","1161","233","0","441","2013-08-26T04:15:34-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.576CB0CE514496D4757668D15E3CF723","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","576CB0CE514496D4757668D15E3CF723","188644","Brussels, Belgium","la_viajera_constanta","en","false","2020-11-10T06:21:40-05:00","5","Despite the rather frightening description in older guide books, this is a beautiful and safe walk.

This takes you to the falls which are spectacular!
What we did was park at the church, go to the back and up the steps to the start of the trail.  The trail hovered the side of a canyon with some drop-off sections but not dangerous as the wire rope fencing kept us safe.  The trail is mostly dirt and rock.  We could see Levada Nova above us at times.  Great views all along the trail with a nice picnic stop about ¾ of the way down.  We went up the steps to the falls and back to the church via Levada Nova.

If you suffer from vertigo, I suggest you do not do Levada Nova as it has steep drop-offs without any rope fencing in places.   What you can do is go to the falls then turn around and head back the same way you came along Levada Moinho.  
Both trails not busy when we went in January.

From the bus stop we walked up the road for about 20 min until we rea had the levada Nova. We then took this and walked up a beautiful valley with great views. The path was clear and not many bumps. While often there were rails, this was not always the case - so may be a challenge for those not liking heights. We walked along until near the top of the valley there was a tunnel flowed by a lovely water fall, very beautiful. A lite further on the top.of the valley is reached. At this point one desends to the levada Moinho and take the walk back to the village. Each levada is about 30m height difference, but the views and feel of each levada were very different. At the end of the levada we went back down the hill to the bus stop (designated by two yellow lines on the road).

In all of the literature we went through before coming to the island, it details a long loop trail starting and ending at the church. The hike is mostly flat, with an altitude change of 100 meters/300 feet in the last leg of the hike. We decided to do the loop in reverse of the recommendations to do the altitude first, then mostly flat back to the church. And this was by far the best way to approach it, not because the altitude change is difficult in any way (it is on paved roads, and easily maneuvered in either direction), but the first sight of the falls at the far end of the loop when arriving is most certainly the best way to discover them. You know you are almost there when you reach a tunnel. The view as you exit the tunnel is straight out of a great novelist or artists mind. It was so amazing that we laughed when we first played back the GoPro video I shot while passing through exit of the tunnel and I said “Oh Wow” out loud unintentionally. It is truly magnificent, we got to the trail head at 8am, and were alone on the trail out, and were alone at the falls the whole time we were there. We sat and marveled at the site from the many places available there, and from behind the falls themselves as the Levada trail is carved out of the rock as a passageway going around and behind the falls. The little canyon the falls are in is very unique and beautiful, and the falls are a not to miss while living place. We also recommend doing the altitude first is that at this point you will also have done the most challenging part of the hike first, due to most of it is walking along a two foot wide concrete Levada wall that also passes along multiple spots of sheer cliffs. You are walking along with 200 to 500 meters of oftentimes near sheer drop of a cliff on your left, and with only intermittent guide wire rails. It is not for anyone with vertigo issues, but also not too much for an avid hiker. The views are consistently so amazing that you are nearly unable to worry about the trail. The trail back starts with some rock stairs down to the Levada that brings you back to the church (actually pops out in the church yard). This part of the hike is equally as wonderful as the first half with water stairs, and descents that are a real treat as you follow the water on this part.","A MUST DO","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","79","0","0","10","65","49","0","138","2016-12-14T07:12:10-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7B054337BAE540520BA1A05524A82BF2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7B054337BAE540520BA1A05524A82BF2","34242","Gainesville, Florida","wmerry2016","en","false","2019-08-23T18:20:52-04:00","5","This time I went solo and used it as walking meditation.

Furthermore, the pricing is simply fraudulent where they charge you for the for what appears to be the price per 100 grams.

We picked however the word forced would be more appropriate, 2 passion fruits, 2 dragon fruits and 4 bananas (which were a freebie) and were charged €26!!!

The first was very pleasant, with a bit of a climb back from the Wind Lagoon up to a higher Lagoon where we stopped for lunch, which was nice and peaceful.  The Larano walk was also good, although it started with a steady climb and included more vertiginous parts.
It is a wonderful way to spend a day, in beautiful landscapes with many stunning views.

I went with Madeira Explorers as my wife does not like heights and so I would have been on my own otherwise.
The Fanal walk included quite a way walking through the woods as well as some higher paths with great views, although by lunchtime the cloud had spoiled some of these.
For the Peaks walk we were lucky in that we started in  lovely sunshine which made for great views, although it was harder than the Fanal walk, especially as most is on stone paths which I found quite hard on my feet.  (I am glad that I warmed up by walking from Lido to Monte and back via central Funchal as a warm up a few days earlier).  
A stick was helpful as was my headtorch.
The guides on both were interesting, although having done quite a number of walks I should know most of the interesting facts by now!
Coffee was very good value at the start and end of the Fanal walk, although the difficulty in getting the coffee up to Pico Ruivo did seem to be reflected in the price, double that of the others.   Walkers should be aware that the loos on the Peaks walk cost €0.50.
Overall they were really enjoyable walks.","Fanal enjoyable, the peaks harder, but amazing views","2022-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/6f/02/f5/charliecb.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/6f/02/f5/charliecb.jpg","259","0","119","72","6","397","0","728","2008-05-07T15:24:20-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.C0DDDF513EA4BC5AA8305FC95DCD318F","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","C0DDDF513EA4BC5AA8305FC95DCD318F","187049","Swindon, United Kingdom","CharlieCB","en","false","2021-09-11T12:36:55-04:00","4","We booked and paid for the Kings Levada Walk.

The website is clear and the e-mail communication for booking and for organising the pick-up was very good.

We chose the Rabaçal / Risco / 25 Fontes walk as it looked like the most interesting route.

We were picked up at exactly the planned time and there were eight people in our minibus.  There was a stop part-way for last-minute lunch shopping (and WCs) but we were pleased to have been to a supermarket in Funchal the day before.

The total number of people on the walk that Thursday was over 30 and so we were split up into two groups with separate guides.  Our guide (Marguerita) was fluent in both English and German, enough to be able to joke in both languages.  She shared loads of interesting information throughout the walk.

It was bright and dry in Funchal, but in the mountains it was heavy rain all day.  In some sections you do have to walk through shallow water.  If doing it again we would wear proper walking boots rather than our lighter walking shoes.

Torches were provided for the section in the 800-metre tunnel.

We felt that it was slightly expensive and that it could have been easier to pay by card (we had to be dropped off at the office where the people didn't seem to be expecting us).","Good way of seeing the mountains and levadas from the hotel areas","2020-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/a1/00/00/counting-boy.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/a1/00/00/counting-boy.jpg","13","0","36","29","12","36","0","78","2010-08-30T13:35:16-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6907EA310F9CDEC22F23612EACD87B23","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","6907EA310F9CDEC22F23612EACD87B23","504181","Reigate, United Kingdom","Counting_Boy","en","false","2020-01-08T06:38:45-05:00","5","We booked the 25 waterfalls levada walk at Rabacal with Sunny tours and were very impressed with Madeira Explorers,who operated the tour. The pick up was on time, the guide was excellent and his knowledge of the flora and fauna was outstanding. The walk was done at a reasonable pace although one part was particularly hilly due to a rockfall causing a diversion.

A very enjoyable day out.

Walk ‘Alecrim’ because it’s less crowded than ‘Risco’ and ‘25 Fontes’, both starting at the same parking lot. ‘Alecrim’ is as beautiful and interesting as the two others, and the waterfall in the end is a little more spectacular.
2. ‘Alecrim’ is 6,8 km - out + back - and takes about 2 hours to walk in moderate pace, shooting a lot of pictures along the track.
3. ‘Alecrim’ is considered one of the easiest levadas - children and elderly people can do it without problems.
4. Wear trainers or walking shoes. Sticks are not needed.
5. Don’t be afraid of the sun - you walk in the shade of trees all the way.
6. Consider bringing bathing suit and towel if you feel like taking a shower in the (pretty cold) waterfall.
7. START EARLY, 9 AM or earlier! We started out at 9.15, there were only 5 cars at the parking lot. 1 hour later, on our way back from the waterfall, we met 60-70 people heading for the waterfall, some of them walking in big groups - and every time you meet a person on the narrow path, you have to step aside and wait (pretty annoying).

In the end of the Levada you have two water falls and can take a bath if you want (very cold water).

It took is 50mins to get to the waterfall and 43 to come back, so a good walk but not too much

You have a lot of free parking at the beginning of the trail

You need good walking shoes because it has small rocks all the way and it can get uncomfortable if the sole is thin. Also when we were getting back it started raining and it can get a bit more slippery . 

Elevation is virtually not there except a flight of stairs. I saw a lot of people with small kids, dogs and elderly people being comfortable all the way.

You have 3 viewpoints where you see the alley, pretty spots. The walking via the levada you walk in a tunnel of woods, I find that the prettiest part. Then at the end there are 2 waterfalls. The second one, that you see from above,I find is the prettiest.

Oh, and the road there is a steep mountain road, need a good car, but this is all the island. You can get into the cloud too. Or you can stop and see the surrounding scenery .

Wij hebben deze hebben deze wandeling samen gecombineerd met 'Levada do Vento' wat heel goed te doen is. 

Je loopt dus eigenlijk door tot de waterval van Alecrim waar je trouwens op een warme dag een heerlijke frisse duik kan nemen.
Van daaruit kan je niet anders dan terug keren omdat hier ook het pad ophoud.

Bij de wegwijzer ""Levado do Vento' daal je af naar beneden via de trappen, deze zal je ook weer omhoog moeten lopen om daarna de route te vervolgen naar Rabacal, waar je even lekker kan bijkomen bij het restaurantje. Je kan natuurlijk ook weer de trappen terug omhoog pakken, wat ik zelf niet zou advisere.

Mocht je geen zin meer hebben om de gehele wandeling vanaf het restaurant naar boven te lopen dan kan je daar tegen betaling een busje pakken die je weer naar boven brengt.

There are lots of little slides which were perfect for our 5 year old. The pools were very cold though and the main small pool is a little tired. A major negative was that there were lots of paint chips in this pool, let alone leaves etc, which weren't nice to walk/ swim in. The lazy river didn't have much of a current and there weren't enough rubber rings so people had to wait a long time for people to finish with them. The bigger slides were good and would keep older kids and adults occupied! More shade is needed so the young kids can get out of the sun for a while but it's too windy for parasols. The animal show was ok (not sure about parrots riding bikes!) but the flights of the larger birds of prey were impressive. Felt like the small cages and baskets the animals were in was concerning. The show was all in Portuguese so we would have liked a bit of translation but appreciate its a Portuguese island! 
Cafe was very reasonably priced with lots of family friendly food. Little one loved 'meeting' 'Mickey' and 'Minnie' (or as we said Miguel and Maria Mouse!).

In addition our grandparents have to pay full price even so clearly they weren’t going to swim and only wanted to spend a day out with the family. There are websites online which give information about family tickets and discount prices for over 65 which in reception immediately deny saying that is not true or are out of date.

In general the facilities are ok but it is an average park which is very overpriced for Madeira standards. We did the most of it and it was just ok as we travelled with my cousin’s children but if you don’t have children I’d avoid it as it will get boring very quickly.

On the positive, the rides are great, with a good variety for different levels.  There are three quite challenging rides: high, twisty, fast etc.  There are two helter-skelter type rides for medium levels. And there are two for very young kids, including a rubber-ring floating ride.  And there are a couple of paddling pools.

Sun beds were a little expensive in our opinion at €3 each and we were not able to hire a parasol as it was a little too windy the day we visited.
Weather was colder than Funchal in the morning but brightened up in the day so worth checking the weather out before visiting as it does vary across the island.
Photos taken by the photographer cost €10 each which we felt was expensive despite some money going towards an animal sanctuary.
The parrot show was very entertaining 👏
Taxi from Funchal was £60 for 6 of us, there was/is also the option of buses. Entrance was €8 for adults and €5 for kids which we think is good value.

However the “art” work on display was so mediocre and I could not believe that this was the best of Portuguese contemporary art. Nothing was inspiring, unique or thought provoking. The printed information from the exhibiting artist and curator was just a collection of words that meant very little. 
The gift shop was also uninspiring and certainly did not encourage you to buy. 
Found it strange that the gallery closed for lunch? Have never come across that before when visiting a national gallery. 
I would certainly recommend visiting the exterior and interior of the building but leave the visitor to make up their own mind when looking at the art work.","Amazing Building but……..","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/ae/1f/1f/rhona-c.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/ae/1f/1f/rhona-c.jpg","90","0","68","118","22","191","0","399","2012-11-24T11:41:02-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6D5D7506124568D659AD4FFAD13F75FB","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","6D5D7506124568D659AD4FFAD13F75FB","186411","Leeds, United Kingdom","943RhonaC","en","false","2022-04-23T10:44:19-04:00","1","Receptionist not very helpful, only place on island asked for vaccine certificates that I had to walk back to car for, to be told it was closing in half hour for an hour's lunch!!!!!! left","Awkward receptionist","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/19/20/61/01/fredmx9617ep.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/20/61/01/fredmx9617ep.jpg","1","0","0","4","0","10","0","15","2009-03-13T14:51:24-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.1A1FFABF508A66038B602A2F6C94E90D","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","1A1FFABF508A66038B602A2F6C94E90D","186424","Worcester, United Kingdom","fredmX9617EP","en","false","2022-04-03T08:43:06-04:00","3","An absolutely stunning building in a wonderful position.

The building itself is a great modern building which provides nice space for the art.  

The works are quite varied and modern, which we really enjoyed.

We were hoping to get a coffee there but the coffee shop was not open on the Sunday morning we visited.

Sebastiao in 1569, the Jesuits' College of Funchal marked, throughout the centuries, the lives of the inhabitants of Madeira Island. For more than 400 years of history, it served a number of tenants, from British invaders to the University of Madeira, coming to serve as a military facility and a number of schools. Despite its military applications, it has always kept a close relationship with education. Portrayed as ""one of the most remarkable buildings that exist in the island"" by historian and professor at the University of Madeira Rui Carita, the Jesuits' College of Funchal is the stage of a cultural and scientific awareness project lead by the Students' Union meant for both local residents and visitors of the region. The inauguration of another Gaudeamus - AAUMa Academic Store at the entrance of the College was the starting point of its opening for the general public. Added to it was a circuit of autonomous tours of the College, as well as monthly gatherings for Coimbra Fado and a service of guided tours, whose circuit includes reserved areas of the University of Madeira Rectory, among others. The Students' Union has also published The Jesuits' College of Funchal - A History, by Rui Carita, a book that narrates the history of the College, its tenants and its transformations throughout the centuries. These are projects that, above all, show the spirit of this institution, which benefits from a precious asset both scarce and undervalued in this country; the volunteer work and the dedication of a solid team. Everyone's contribute will be vital, even if in the form of a simple visit to our store. Only then will we be able to continue financing all of the projects that we have to offer to both our associates and the population, whether free of charge or under a symbolic price.",,,"eu.portugal.madeira_islands.funchal","colegio@aauma.pt","Atlantic/Madeira",,,,,"1110","600",,,"1110","600",,,"1110","600",,,"1110","600",,,"1110","600",,,"960","600",,,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/b2/b4/da/colegio-dos-jesuitas.jpg","false","false","false","false","32.65011","4060002","Funchal, Madeira, Madeira Islands","none","-16.909418","Colegio dos Jesuitas do Funchal","579","true","true","$0.17",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/07/3d/43/c4.jpg","","Viator","$15.42","Cultural Tours","10440P2","$16","Old Funchal Walking Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FFunchal%2FHistory-Tellers%2Fd22388-10440P2%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=e31956823349698e6&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=4060002&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/77/91/52.jpg","","Viator","$15.42","Private Sightseeing Tours","10440P5","$16","The Mysteries of Funchal Walking Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FMadeira%2FThe-Mysteries-of-Funchal-Walking-Tour%2Fd5392-10440P5%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=16df3f2938b55b335&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=2&cnt=1&geo=4060002&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0b/16/e5/95.jpg","","Viator","$467.00","Walking Tours","224720P406","$467","Best of Funchal private walking tour with local specialities tasting","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FFunchal%2FBest-of-Funchal-private-walking-tour-with-local-specialities-tasting%2Fd22388-224720P406%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=9846c3d8ba115f276&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=3&cnt=1&geo=4060002&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Closed Now","Funchal","+351 291 705 060","Colégio dos Jesuítas do Funchal.","3","129152218","682","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/07/b2/b4/da/colegio-dos-jesuitas.jpg","1024","367","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/b2/b4/da/colegio-dos-jesuitas.jpg","550","1333","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/b2/b4/da/colegio-dos-jesuitas.jpg","2000","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/b2/b4/da/colegio-dos-jesuitas.jpg","150","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/b2/b4/da/colegio-dos-jesuitas.jpg","50","true","2015-04-14T18:49:37-0400","2015-04-14T18:49:37-0400","0","user",,"default","#20 of 446 things to do in Madeira","attraction","446","Madeira","189166","20","#20 of 446 things to do in Madeira","4.5","4.017867565155029","en","false","2022-09-12T07:17:53-04:00","5","We visited the church.

The college was founded in 1569 and until the C19th was the largest building on the island and built round two courtyards. It was responsible for educating boys until the Jesuits were expelled from the island in 1760. 

It is a simple white building with dark basalt surrounds to the windows. An archway leads into the main courtyard with a well. Off is the shop and cafe.

Audio guides are provided in English, German, French and Portuguese. On Saturdays students run guided tours lasting 90 minutes. I joined one of these and was the only person on the tour. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and I learnt a lot not only about the Jesuits but also the history and economy of Madeira.

I was shown around he corridors surrounding the main courtyard which was used by the students. The Jesuits sat at window seats and watched the students and ensured good discipline. The smaller courtyard was used by the priests and is private.

I went into what is now the general council room but was once part of the library. This was designed with a domed ceiling which amplified any sound however quiet. - a good way of enforcing silence... 

This was a very worthwhile visit.","Well worth while finding","2019-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","272","0","3","22","128","31","0","325","2014-08-29T04:22:12-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.DE8BF4B04F854245B66A6ED8C120EFC8","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","DE8BF4B04F854245B66A6ED8C120EFC8","186335","Lincolnshire, United Kingdom","EESW1","en","false","2019-05-22T04:27:15-04:00","5","If you are in Madeira and even if you are not religious in any way a visit to this fantastic church is a must.

Protected from the wins by the valley, it worth’s the 300 or more steps you will have to climb back.
Don’t missed, assure you go there middle of the morning on weekday to avoid the weekend and afternoon crowd.
Ideally choose the low tide hours, to maximize your experience, it is a relative small beach. Reserve at least 2 to 3 hours to be there and relax.

Unfortunately:
1. It's miles from Funchal, overlooking a tiny nondescript town on the southwest coast. You really need to want to go there to make the effort. An extra challenge is the absence of clear signage to show you the way in once you get there.
2. Most late 20th century contemporary art seems to be conceptual: weak or strong ideas, well or poorly executed, successful or unsuccessful in communicating emotionally with the viewer. Sadly, almost everything in these cavernous white spaces falls into the weak ideas, averagely executed, and largely failing to communicate. The usual method to cover that is a pretentious artist's statement intended to make the viewer feel it's all their fault for not understanding - see the example below.
3. The centre wins one prize however, for having a cafe with the most disgusting and poorly maintained toilets on the island.

Discovering it was a gallery of modern art raised our interest but we didn't have high expectations. It would be a challenge to access without a car but if you do make it it's well worthwhile . A beautiful space with beautiful art  . I particularly loved the work of Lourdes Castro . She used a variety of mediums with simplicity and impact. We were the only people in the gallery , so how they keep it going I'm not sure .

It is quite enchanting in the surface, with small side streets and lots of cafes and restaurants to choose from. There is a small cove/ pebbled beach area which is mainly occupied by local fishing boats. It is nice on a sunny day, but can be windy and bleak on a bad day. There isn’t that much to do in the town once you’ve looked around, although there are a couple of nice bakeries. One thing to be wary of in this small town are a couple of cafe/ restaurants that will rip you off. One in particular is the Sunny Bar cafe which I would advise anyone to avoid at all costs, even if you’re desperate.","Nice for a short visit","2022-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","9","0","0","21","10","27","0","57","2015-10-06T16:29:06-0400","Ed","N","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.594B9956D30C59F3C67384D6DEEE606A","en_UK","0","Ed N","0",,"user","594B9956D30C59F3C67384D6DEEE606A","186250","Devon, United Kingdom","Ed N","en","false","2021-11-30T05:16:39-05:00","4","We started from our hotel near the Lido and walked the coast path, through the tunnel to end in Camara which overall took about 90 minutes.

It is worth the very reasonable fare to spend a few hours to familiarise yourself with the place that Churchill liked. Make sure to go to the bar where Churchill's statue is and walk the side streets with collages made out of recycled materials. We had a lovely lunch at Deserta Pequena where we were served with excellent starter of Chicken Samosas with almond and carrot sauce. Very unusual and delicious. We had the famous Black Scabbardfish for our main which was cooked to perfection. We were served a complimentary posha liqueur which finished our lunch.

A few character cafes are nearby, but the main delight of what was once a small fishing village is the sea-sided walk to the east of the harbour. This takes you past (now smartened up) fishing cottages, an old lime kiln, sea swimming pool and underneath some spectacularly stratified cliffs.  Stop when you reach the end which overlooks the cement factory in the next bay (or if you are really energetic you can continue the walk all the way back to Funchal).
The village is easily reached by local bus from Funchal (15 different bus nos. – get a local bus map and buy a Giro pre-paid fare card) which can be combined with a visit to the nearby Cabo Girao Cliffs.","Fishing village favoured by Winston Churchill  – now much developed.","2019-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","71","0","98","34","7","54","0","159","2010-09-08T17:37:49-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.4143D092D1C4CE25D5DCE10CB63A500E","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","4143D092D1C4CE25D5DCE10CB63A500E","190817","Weymouth, United Kingdom","eaglesclan","en","false","2019-12-08T09:13:55-05:00","5","I decided to go for a walk from the ship after leaving the port I headed along the promenade passing cafes and restaurants","Walk ashore","2019-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/b7/35/6e/fisherman890.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/b7/35/6e/fisherman890.jpg","79","0","22","19","231","101","0","200","2012-03-17T16:15:13-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.5FDD11C5E443F8B9F67786809C44B226","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","5FDD11C5E443F8B9F67786809C44B226","227059","Sunderland, United Kingdom","fisherman890","en","false","2019-12-06T09:11:45-05:00","5","but the stretch near Camara de Lobos is best because it is a walk by the sea all the way and no traffic fumes!

However this was even overshadowed by an unfriendly lady behind the desk who acted like I was stupid and wasn’t very keen to give additional info. Only after repeatedly asking for it, since we had been driving for an hour to visit the place, she gave in.
Bought another €6 shot of (good) rum. However did not manage to set aside my frustration so I didn’t buy a bottle, only so that I wouldn’t be reminded of that woman every time I drank the rum at home.

We were touring the coast and stopped off in the nearby car park to look at the bay (surfing and other watersports available) before strolling to the historic building.  You could say we ""arrived under our own steam"" lol.  Its a real, working distillery, with free entry and free tastings available.  You can purchase direct from the manufacturer - we got a few bottles for gifts - keeping down our retail carbon footprint.  A self-guided tour is available with a video, in English, running to show the complete process.  All the exhibits are labelled, in Portuguese and English.  Rum is made from sugar cane, which is grown across Madeira.  This arrives in flat bed vehicles and is loaded by grab crane (see photo) before being crushed to extract the sugar syrup.  The remainder of the plant is used as fuel for the steam engine (see photo) as it is burnt on site.  The sugar syrup is then the ingredient used as fermentation to produce the alcohol which is then distilled to give the high strength final liquor for cask ageing and bottling.  Its a really clever set up.  They do not run at full production every day - they were not working during our visit - but the video shows the scene and the exhibits bring it to life.  Great insight into the whole process.  You can finish the tour in the gift shop where you can sample the rum produced and also, should you wish to, purchase drinks for consumption on and off the premises.  The 'poncha' is freshly made and you can have a creamy cocktail containing it too.  They had a special rum called 'Fire' which apparently, although strong, doesn't burn your throat like some rum does.  Tours of the island often visit here and two 4x4 vehicles, full of tourists, arrived whilst we were there.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the experience, particularly those sampling the final product!

Not only is it cheaper but it provides a leisurely way to visit the beautiful area on the way to and at the village of Porto da Cruz. The village offers good walks in a dramatic landscape, with a good selection of restaurants and cafes. 
The Distillery itself operates April and May when the steam operated machinery can be seen working, but can be visited at other times to sample the product at very reasonable cost.","An interesting visit in the north east of the island","2019-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","31","0","0","17","0","8","0","56","2015-07-30T16:33:31-0400","David","D","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.88E6A6AE72E1F8327BA182E446A580C2","en_UK","0","David D","0",,"user","88E6A6AE72E1F8327BA182E446A580C2","1231832","Blakeney, United Kingdom","David D","en","false","2019-06-08T09:08:37-04:00","5","This is good for a quick afternoon visit.

Once at Boca do Risco there were great views along the coastline. We walked along the coastal path through woods providing shade before coming out and skirting round a cliff face. From a distance the path cut into the cliffs looks imposing however the path was wide enough but one needs to take care when walking - some fencing in parts ..... Very tall cliffs afforded great views. We then continued along the path through larano and down to Porto da Cruz, a nice small village on the coast.

We were dropped at a dead-end overlooking PontaD'Cruz., which is awesome to look back on during the first 1km of rugged but level wide path. From then on it's all single width as it weaves through some shaded forest. Then the path then wraps itself around the cliff at some altitude and is precarious in many places, where there are sheer cliff drops and NO guard rails. Your risk, but our guide was ensuring we had good foot-holdings, thank goodness. Our morning was cloudless so quite hot & humid in places. Look down the cliff to the sea...it was a rare calm sea day on the north side.

C'est une mise en jambes paisible.
Au bout d'une heure on quitte la levada pour emprunter un chemin non signalé pour arriver après une heure de montée raide au Boca do Risco, superbe point de vue sur la mer, où on peut déjeuner tranquille.
Ensuite on suit un chemin escarpé qui serpente à flanc de falaise à 300m au-dessus de la mer. On découvre vers l'est des points de vue superbes sur la Pointe Saint-Laurent. On marche vers l'ouest pendant 2 heures avant d'arriver au-dessus de Porto da Cruz, petite station balnéaire encaissée au pied du rocher de l'Aigle. Les points de vue sur la côte sont superbes. La descente vers Porto da Cruz le long d'une levada prend 1/2 heure.
La randonnée dure donc 4h30 (hors pause déjeuner) et ne présente pas de difficulté particulière.

Subindo uma elevação de aproximadamente 300 metros, alcança-se um platô grande com uma vista soberba sobre parte da Ponta de São Lourenço e sobre o Porto Santo (dependendo da neblina no local), bem como da zona nordeste da Ilha da Madeira.

Essa trilha era orginalmente usada pelos aldeões como ligação entre a costa norte e a costa sul da Ilha da Madeira, entre as vilas de Machico e Porto da Cruz.

O ponto de partida dessa caminhada acontece junto à chamada “casa dos levadeiros”, tendo nesse momento a companhia do curso hídrico da Levada dos Maroços, que conduz para o cenário dos campos agrícolas cultivados com frutos e legumes típicos daquela área, num misto de interação com os pequenos bosques exóticos.

Até à primeira etapa do percurso (Levada dos Maroços), o cenário é tranquilo e comandado pelos tradicionais poios agrícolas. Seguindo o trilho que se encontra bem visível, rapidamente chega à Boca do Risco e a partir daqui é fácil perceber porque é considerado um dos miradouros naturais mais bonitos da zona leste da Ilha.

A Vereda da Boca do Risco é por si só um trajeto muito interessante e envolvente, que termina de forma emblemática, tendo no miradouro natural da Boca do Risco, o ex-libris de toda a caminhada, pois a vista sobre o Oceano Atlântico é soberba, assim como também a Ponta de São Lourenço, a Penha d’Águia e se o tempo permitir a ilha do Porto Santo. A partir daqui a trilha poderá ter dois sentidos, ou seja, seguir o sentido da freguesia do Caniçal ou o lado oposto, o sentido da freguesia do Porto da Cruz.

Optamos pela segunda alternativa.

Todos os trilhos associados aos percursos costeiros, efetuados através da escarpa da montanha, outrora caminhos reais que serviam para as pessoas se deslocarem entre as vilas de Machico e Porto da Cruz são caminhos mais vulneráveis à erosão e como tal mais suscetíveis de desgaste.

A trilha é estreita e vertiginosa sendo escorregadia durante os meses mais úmidos.

No caminho até Porto da Cruz é possível observar uma das formações rochosas mais emblemáticas da Madeira: a Penha D’Águia.

O percurso até o Larano a partir da Boca do Risco é um trajeto deslumbrante do ponto de vista paisagístico, mas que oferece riscos inerentes que merecem cuidados extras aos caminhantes, principalmente experiência. Em algumas zonas de desgaste, foram colocados cabos de aço que auxiliam a mobilidade.

Ao chegar ao Larano, a vegetação endémica é substituída por espécies exóticas, mantendo, no entanto, a intensidade verdejante. A vereda termina praticamente no Caminho do Cabo do Larano, onde existe um pequeno teleférico para uso exclusivamente dos moradores locais e trabalhadores.

Daqui pode optar por descer até à Vila do Porto da Cruz.

Von da an läuft man stetig entlang der Küste auf ca. 350 Metern Höhe.
Die Wanderung lohnt sich alleine durch den tollen Ausblick.
Der Weg ist zum Teil schmal und es geht nebenan den Hang hinunter. Da er jedoch ausreichend gesichert ist, hatten wir nie ein ungutes Gefühl.
Der einzige Nachteil bei uns war am Ende der Wanderung, dass wir den Bus um 13:15 Uhr knapp verpasst hatten und nicht bis ca. 17 Uhr auf den nächsten warten wollten. Das Taxi hat zurück zum Startpunkt der Wanderung, an dem unser Mietwagen stand, 20€ gekostet.
Trotz des Taxi Preises würden wir die Tour bei einem nächsten Besuch wieder machen.

Funchal was a very interesting destination with some unique history. Being on a cruise ship, tours are offered for pretty much everything, but unable to do in the seven hours that was allowed for shore leave. 

Except!!!! If you do it by taxi. We were fortunate to find Luis Abreu a taxi driver. We took the Cruise-ship shuttle to central downtown. That is where we met Luis, a 20 year old college student/taxi driver full of energy and information about his home island.  He provided a four hour tour which included almost all the sites provided by the cruise-ship tours. It is with his permission I provide his contact information.

Maybe just my cynicism, but perhaps this is because there's no real scope for them to promote money making island tourism businesses?
This was most obvious when it came to our enquiring about the islands 3 bus companies (few of the walks on the island are circular so you need very precise information about bus routes and timings for the start and end of your walk). The tourist office did have one, rather battered folder containing most of the timetables, to be consulted in the office. It actually requires quite careful study if you're new to the island--and the presence of a queue of people all, quite reasonably, wanting to look at the same folder did not contribute to the experience. Eventually we tracked down the websites of the companies and for most routes you could download pdf timetables. Why oh Why did the tourist office staff not have the wit (or go to the small trouble) of producing a single sheet containing the website addresses.

Our view of the enterprise was confirmed by our second attempt to visit the tourist office. It was the opening day of the February carnival--a saturday--and it wouldn't be that surprising if visitors to the island wanted to find out about the programme. But they certainly couldn't find out anything from the tourist office. It was closed and shuttered--begging the question 'What's it for?.","Oh!! You want information?

We've been coming to Madeira regularly for over 30 years and don't recall ever getting any useful information, offered in a pleasant or friendly manner. Nowadays you can't even get comprehensive bus timetables there!

On our last visit, nearly a year ago, we went in to enquire about the opening times of Sugar Museum. We were told it couldn't be visited as it was shut. As its website said the contrary, but didn't give times, we went along to see, 350 metres away  - and found it had been open for 6 months! (See my separate review).

We also enquired whether the Office had any lists or other information of holiday apartments to rent for - as every tourist office anywhere has - and were told no!  But then the lady reached into her handbag and handed us a business card, saying her friend had an apartment. Fishy, or what?

We enjoyed walking along the beach and dipping our toes in the water. Walk to the other end of the beach to stand under a small waterfall and discover small caves to explore. We didn't stay to relax on the beach as we had an action-packed touristy day ahead of us.

We visited to experience a black sand beach (which was great), but also we had read that there are sea caves at the Seixal natural pools that you can swim in. I read, ""The natural pools are easily accessible via the concrete stairs and the pools are calm to swim in, even if the sea just outside is rough. Remember to bring towels to lie out on. Entrance is free.""  Maybe it was low tide or something? but we totally did not experience anything like this!  The rock pool we saw is located just across the concrete walkway from the black send beach, yes there are concrete steps down but these just lead to an area with very large pebbles/stones that is extremely difficult to walk on. The water is far away and so shallow you would have to wade out for a long long way, not at all feasible on the treacherous large pebbles/rocks. There was an archway that looked like it might be a sea cave but we couldn't get anywhere near it. (see photos)

That was the only disappointing part of our trip though. There is a mini viewpoint that just takes a couple of minutes to climb up to and from there you can see lovely views across the natural pool to the sea.

There are showers, toilets and a cafe next to the beach. Parking is free, but aim to arrive early before 11am as after that it gets very busy.

Note: when driving to/from Seixel, visit the nearby Miradouro do Véu da Noiva to see a waterfall that leads straight into the ocean. This viewpoint is beautiful and extremely easy to reach as only a few seconds walk from the nearby parking lot.","The black sand beach is great and we recommend, but the 'natural rock pools' is very misleading!!","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2e/f5/96/laura-t.jpg","565","0","85","79","484","178","0","822","2012-05-30T06:47:33-0400","Laura","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","en_UK","0","Laura T","0",,"user","8B35ECAE17066B134FBCE5CAAC93ECC2","186340","Middlesbrough, United Kingdom","Laura T","en","false","2022-11-18T21:56:54-05:00","1","Please be aware of how dangerous this place is.
