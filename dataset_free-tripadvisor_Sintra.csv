It’s 3€’s but there is a discount for senior citizens. At weekends I believe one buys the ticket on the tram, first come first served. The tram was built in 1945. It’s an authentic ride. Bumpy, very noisy and uncomfortable but scenic too. Can’t really see how it makes a profit. Even taking into account the bumpiness of the tram and the incredible noise I think the price should be higher. One arrives at the beach at Macas after a 45 min journey. The tram is very clean and well looked after the tram driver was friendly and a very good driver.

There is an obvious lack of info on timetables and where and when to buy tickets. At some stops you could buy directly with the driver, others you had to go to a shop but the sign didn’t really tell you where this shop was... some people where queuing at the stop for hours until they realised all seats were taken by other turists that bought tickets at the shop.. on our way back they oversold tickets So some passengers offered to stand up to allow for all children to have a seat... on the way in the team crashed with a car, on the way back it lost power and the cable had to be adjusted. The team was late most days, as in 30 40 min late seriously I was equally upset for my family and other tourists as I was for the tram operators that seemed to spend the day firefighting. 

As a Portuguese citizen myself I felt embarrassed and really wish someone capable of planning and setting up clear and transparent procedures took over this operation ASAP. It is a national historical treasure and could / should be beautiful and educational rather than frustrating and scary.","Poor planning but a fun experience","2019-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg","2","0","11","16","0","0","0","18","2012-12-28T13:59:19-0500","Silvia","R","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.716ED95DA96F1EA9AD4E70242C260E50","en_UK","0","Silvia R","0",,"user","716ED95DA96F1EA9AD4E70242C260E50","186220","Bristol, United Kingdom","Silvia R","en","false","2019-08-23T14:57:42-04:00","5","Sintra Tram is a great experience.

The journey takes 45 - 50 minutes. The tram is NOT accessible to wheelchairs. Steps up inside. It seats only 24 with a few standing. On weekdays tickets must be bought before boarding at the Vila Alda shop next door to the tram stop. At weekends tickets are sold on board. It is first come, first served. Alas the service has been reduced to only three journeys each day, so get there early.

The first 10 minutes is a steep downhill descent, with much screeching of brakes and squealing of flanges as the tramcar tries to get away. There is a hairpin bend at the end of that section, after which the line undulates through neat villages and wooded hills. The terminus at Praia da Maças is next to the beach.

Parts of the ride are very bumpy and most of the seats are the original wooden ones.

It's a pleasant trip, but there is not much effort made to expand the experience. Just go for the ride.","Slow ride to the beach!","2019-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/ca/8a/03/cubsur.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/ca/8a/03/cubsur.jpg","39","0","21","28","26","6","0","73","2005-09-30T00:00:00-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.C7B044A40091C1793746E6E41442D063",,"0",,"0",,"user","C7B044A40091C1793746E6E41442D063","189112","Albufeira, Portugal","cubsur","en","false","2019-07-08T02:42:57-04:00","4","when in Sintra  to get about, you can walk, get a taxi, get a tuk tuk, or you can get a tram.

Sintra is a must-see but it’s a very full day, so leave early and plan ahead. Without a doubt, the dazzling Disney-land like Pena Palace was the highlight.
TIPS:
i) TRAIN – the train from Rossio Station at Lisbon couldn't have been easier. Using a Via Viagem rechargeable card, it cost €4.50 return, departs frequently and was a 40 min direct trip. Car parking is very tricky in Sintra.
ii) ITINERARY – there is so much to see in Sintra that if you don't want to be a slave to your itinerary, you need to make tough choices beforehand about what to see and what to skip. We had 7 hours which was enough time to see the Pena Palace and Park, to hike from the Moors castle to the town centre, have lunch and see the Sintra National Palace. I would have loved to see Quinta de Regaleira but we reluctantly decided that this was too much for 1 day.
iii) TIMING - We arrived at just after 10am. In hindsight, we should have left earlier. Even an hour earlier would have made a big difference to the Pena Palace queues. This is the busiest place where the queues are longest so best to make this your first stop. 
iv) VOLTA DO DUCHE – it’s an easy, flat 10 min walk between the train station and town centre, along the Volta do Duche road. On the way, you’ll see the palace-like Town Hall and pillory, Liberdade Park and a great collection of modern sculptures. 
v) TOURIST INFORMATION – this was the only place we found maps easily. It's located in the centre of town and free walking trails and brochures as well as a ticket office and spotless bathrooms. 
vi) NATIONAL PALACE – The town skyline is dominated by the strikingly unusual two white towers. This palace doesn't get the attention it deserves because of the Pena Palace but it's very beautiful and is easy to visit, being right in the town centre.
vii) CASCAIS? – Several friends suggested catching an uber home and popping into Cascais on the way back but I can't imagine less than a full day in Sintra. We went to Cascais another day instead and it deserves at least half a day on its own, and a full day if you have the time.","Planning A Day Trip to Sintra....","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2020-09-29T15:18:31-04:00","4","The city center is not big, however, the narrow streets are perfect for a walk.

There are often long lines, so visit right after opening, or at closing time for fewer crowds. Join a guided estate tour of Quinta da Reglaeira to learn more about its curious history. – Tripadvisor",,,"eu.portugal",,,"Europe/Lisbon","1140","570","1140","570","1140","570","1140","570","1140","570","1140","570","1140","570","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/14/21/64/e7/initiation-well-at-quinta.jpg","false","false","false","false","38.79459","10623675","Sintra, Sintra Municipality, Lisbon District, Central Portugal","none","-9.396752",,"Initiation Well",,,"986","true","true","$0.78",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/07/31/cd/14.jpg","","Viator","$69.88","Cultural Tours","75161P1","$70","Sintra Stories by Portugal Stories","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FLisbon%2FSintra-Stories%2Fd538-75161P1%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=436ae1dd2ab9937d2&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=10623675&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/07/94/6a/10.jpg","","Viator","$360.50","Historical & Heritage Tours","6883SINTRA","$361","Private Tour: Sintra Day Trip from Lisbon Including Wine Tasting","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FLisbon%2FPrivate-Tour-Sintra-Day-Trip-from-Lisbon-Including-Lunch-and-Wine-Tasting%2Fd538-6883SINTRA%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=34b9c68c5ee391114&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=2&cnt=1&geo=10623675&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Closed Now","Sintra","+351 21 910 6650","Initiation Well at Quinta da Regaleira","8","337732839","682","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/21/64/e7/initiation-well-at-quinta.jpg","1024","366","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/21/64/e7/initiation-well-at-quinta.jpg","550","852","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/14/21/64/e7/initiation-well-at-quinta.jpg","1280","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/21/64/e7/initiation-well-at-quinta.jpg","150","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/21/64/e7/initiation-well-at-quinta.jpg","50","false","2018-08-14T03:56:48-0400","2018-08-14T03:56:48-0400",,"0","user",,"default","#2 of 72 things to do in Sintra","attraction","72","Sintra","189164","2","#2 of 72 things to do in Sintra","5.0","4.247162818908691","en","false","2023-04-12T15:43:51-04:00","5","One of the iconic places in Sintra.

It is about an initiation out of Mother Earth into the light, an ancient principle of humanity.

I think it's a pity that for organisational reasons you have to take the path into the light the wrong way round. That is, into the tower and then through the corridors.

Signature kitchen chimneys that rise nearly a hundred feet make this an instantly recognizable and photogenic location. The walk from the (maddening) train station takes in some exquisite views of the town and valley.

Its excellent location near resturants, ice cream shops, the tourist office and other palaces nearby makes it a great starting point for a day of exploration of Sintra.

By the way, while we saw Quinta da Regaleira with its lovely grounds and Montserrate -  with its distinctive and delicious Arabic styling and lush grounds, we missed the Pena Palace due to time constraints and because quite frankly warnings by several tourists and locals to avoid it at all costs because of the monstrous crush of tourists making a visit unpleasant.

The palace itself was stunning. I recommend getting the audio guide to walk you through the grounds and rooms, however, there is also a room on the top floor that has an very informative video on the history and ownership of the palace. 
The only caveat is that the park and palace close after the bus stops running, so my friends and I got stranded. Be prepared to take an Uber back if you really want to take your time! It's worth it.

They're beautifully maintained, and well worth an hour or two of wandering.

The palace has been wonderfully restored;  you have to see the 'before' pictures to fully appreciate the work that has been done.  I wish we'd have been told to start on the top floor.  This is where all of the information about the history of the palace is.  There's a very interesting video to watch, as well.  I highly suggest starting at the top and working your way down; it will all make much more sense that way.

We stopped at the cafe, and it's a nice place for a drink and a snack (inside or out).  The selection of food is likely much better during high season.

Beware if you're driving to Monserrate - good old google maps sent us to the service entrance (a challenging drive to be avoided at all costs).  This might be a disappointing place for anyone with mobility issues.  Wear proper footwear as the paths can be steep and slippery in places.  

Would LOVE to see this place in summer (although, I fear the crowds would be annoying).","Beautiful gardens and interesting history inside the palace.

I took bus number 403 to Cabo da Roca (either from Sintra or Cascais), stayed there for 15 minutes, and started walking down the road until a small path came into sight on the left where I turned in. It can be recognised easily because it is the first path where cars can drive in and park there. Just follow the path and you’ll be fine. The climb down was not as scary as described on some pages on the Internet, but I would still recommend you to wear sturdy shoes and pay full attention to your steps because the road is very slippery due to the fine sands and small rocks. In my opinion, normal fitness condition is required, children/teens can do that hike as well. When the way splits up, take the left path which is the easier one to hike. After about 35 minutes (10 minutes walk from Cabo da Roca to the path not included) I was finally on the beach, so make sure you have enough time planned if you want to watch the sunset. Be aware of the rocks on the beach, they may hurt you. Now, it was time to lay down in the soft natural sand and relax, or to take beautiful photographs of the magnificent landscape, or observe the wild waves of the Atlantic Ocean splashing on rock formations and the beach. After sunset, you have about 30 minutes to climb up before the sky darkens completely. You’ll be able to catch one of the last busses at Cabo da Roca or just call a taxi. Notice that there is no reception, no Internet, no toilet available on the beach and it might get quite windy on some days, so make sure you are prepared and have everything you need in your day pack!

The highlight of the visit was the Initiation Well, which is a magical and magnificent place. Expect queues, though, as it's a famous place. We paid 11 euros per person to go into Quinta da Regaleira, which was totally worth it, as it's a massive place with loads of lovely gardens and little caves to explore. The Regaleira Palace was also stunning with its wooden ceilings. I was surprised when we got to Sintra by train, though. Although it's super cheap 4.60 euros per person round trip and only takes 40 minutes, I didn't expect the little town to be flooded with tourists! There are two main buses, the 434 which is a hop on hop off and costs 12.50 euros per person to go to different places but we opted to go to Regaleira only, so we took the 435 which is a small bus costing 5.50 per person. Badly organised, it only turns up every 30 minutes and doesn't seem big enough for the amount of people who want to ride it. When we finished at the Regaleira, the bus never turned up so we ended up taking a taxi, which cost so little (3.45 euros) that made me wonder why I didn't take the taxi to go up there in the first place! Apart from the stress regarding transport, the day trip was lovely and I would totally recommend it.","Lovely day trip from Lisbon","2023-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/c4/b5/f5/anaowen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/c4/b5/f5/anaowen.jpg","116","0","23","11","495","87","0","214","2014-04-22T08:39:00-0400","Ana","O","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D0E0F40945FC9C9C8F1823AC7326E98D","en_UK","0","Ana O","0",,"user","D0E0F40945FC9C9C8F1823AC7326E98D","503933","Chorley, United Kingdom","Ana O","en","false","2023-04-10T05:46:04-04:00","5","This place is a jewel and a must visit in Sintra.

One of the most famous architectural components are the Initiation Wells which contain a winding staircase. It is said to carry symbolic meaning including death and rebirth. However, not much is known about its function as it was not a well used to store water. It is believed to have been used for secrative initiation rites related to Masonry and the Knights Templar. There are those that speculate the various attributes such as the nine platforms are “reminiscent of the Divine Comedy by Dante and the nine circles of Hell, the nine sections of Purgatory and the nine skies which constitute Paradise.” In any case, this was a site worth visiting and likely worth visiting more than once in order to really explore all the areas of this beautiful and mysterious estate. #quintadaregaleira #initiationwell","Quinta Da Regaleira & Masonic Initiation Wells","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2021-11-21T10:39:13-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.049060DF5EFFCA18EFA3156DFEF54EBE","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","049060DF5EFFCA18EFA3156DFEF54EBE","55711","Dallas, Texas","Stay66610431741","en","false","2023-04-03T20:10:58-04:00","5","If you visit the Lisbon area but don’t have a lot of time, spend a day in Sintra to visit the Pena Palace in the morning and Quinta da Regaleira in the afternoon.","Another magical place in Sintra","2023-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","27","0","10","30","0","63","0","120","2011-05-04T10:19:26-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.0EFBC3AD3A7B102D74325F9181880EF0","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","0EFBC3AD3A7B102D74325F9181880EF0","60097","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","xcschlr","en","false","2023-03-31T13:35:16-04:00","5","This was probably my favourite out it Peña and Moorish Castle.

Entrance ticket 11eur - spend time in garden, explore all attractions there, including well. I would say 2h would be enough. Garden is very beautiful.

Why? Because it is then an easy walk back to the train station instead of fighting the crowds down from the Palace or Castle.
We found that to get the most out of each place, it is difficult to do more than two sites in the day. And this was on a ‘low’ tourist day..
The house is interesting but the highlight is the gardens. So much to explore, especially the grottos at the bottom of the Initiation Well, which itself is like stepping back to medieval times.
Wander back to the train station and plenty of little gift shops to look in. Allow at least 3 hours including the walk to train station, so perfect to do after lunch.","So much to explore","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","29","0","0","3","0","8","0","40","2019-01-08T01:02:23-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.5D5F124FE69B1C9915D6362656C9B305","en_AU","0",,"0",,"user","5D5F124FE69B1C9915D6362656C9B305",,,"DeeJayM123","en","false","2023-03-03T12:15:03-05:00","5","Absolutely loved this!

We went in Feb and arrived at 11:00 very little crowds and we were able to amble at our own pace!

This grounds are something out of a fairytale. There are caves, ponds, wells, waterfalls and it’s just wonderful. My partner and I had a lovely couple of hours here.

Got a bit busier into the afternoon so maybe earlier is best. 

Easy to access by car and right next to the historical centre.

I can't comment on the view as it was foggy the day I was there, but the fog just added to the mystery and feel of the ruins.

Tickets from the auto machine at the front gate took forever, due to a machine not working, but the wait was worth it. Fabulous, though not ideal for anyone experiencing walking difficulties. Just enjoy what we still have the opportunity to visit. We felt it was a wise move for us to exit the tourist bus at the 1st stop when there were no crowds, which we experienced later in the day.

The history is perhaps a little lighter than I'd hope for what must have been an astounding architectural feat by the Moors, building such a fort so high in the mountains, but the views simply overwhelm my opinion on the castle. Climbing the stone-hewn steps, I almost felt like a cinematic adventurer with the Atlantic wind dangerously close to lifting me away down the hill and no railings to save me (yeah, I would warn you, it was exhilarating but did feel a tad perilous at moments on the walls themselves, and I'm still a youngish man)","Greatest Views in the Lisbon Area?

Did Peña Palace first, then walked down to Moorish Castle, which is about 350m walk.
The initial entrance takes you through paths with plants and trees, and good views.
If you hadn’t bought tickets previously, at the main entrance where the person checks your tickets, you can buy tickets from the automatic booths if you need to.
The walk around the walls is suggested to be one way, start at the right and go around.  Some areas are quite narrow, so it is best to go one way, however some people do like to do their own thing!
Quite steep at times, and high, so not great for those with poor mobility or fear of heights.
Fantastic views on a clear day, and, once at the final top peak, you will get a great view of Peña Palace up on it’s hill at the rear of Moorish Castle.
Free toilets and a basic cafe, but plenty of seating.","Great views.","2022-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","38","0","7","18","0","98","0","154","2013-06-20T05:57:18-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F8678DC737CEABDCE6FE2E27891185A2","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","F8678DC737CEABDCE6FE2E27891185A2","186217","England, United Kingdom","Mauriceb17","en","false","2022-11-05T10:20:35-04:00","5","The history of Sintra starts at this place.

We arrived at 11:45 and the Security Man said we were too early and that the two queues were for 11:30 and 12:00. At 12:00 he said the same but after 5mins we decided to walk up and I am glad we did as our time slot was listed on the board and we joined the line at the start. It was good to go in.

The detail on many of the archways’ and doors’ stonework is stunning and both the “plain” and tiled sections are striking and beautiful, often bringing to mind castles in fairytales.
We came here with a private guide who had sensibly told us to book the first ticket slot - excellent advice as even then there were quite a few people around, but by the time we left it was heaving, with huge queues. We were not told to get transfer tickets, so hadn’t, and indeed the 30 minute walk warned about on the website is more like 10-15 minutes. It is uphill, but it is through part of the park and very pretty, although I can imagine it would be slippery on a wet day.
The interior of the palace is a fascinating mix of styles, from the original monastery cloister, incorporated in a Moorish style, to castle-like and stately-home like parts. The chapel, up a separate flight of stairs from the main indoor sections, has the original altarpiece from the monastery and is definitely worth seeing.
But my favourite parts were the great hall and the kitchen!
There are excellent views on a clear day from both sides of the palace - it was a bit misty when we visited but we could still see quite a way.
There is a takeaway style cafeteria selling drinks and snacks on the upper level (although no seating when we visited as they were maintaining the stone slabs on the outdoor seating area) as well as a restaurant and shop downstairs (which bizarrely had no guidebooks in English when we visited - luckily I can manage Spanish!).
Be aware that, although they do apparently help with access as much as possible, those with any issues with stairs will not be able to access the indoor areas at all.
Definitely worth a visit.","Like a fairytale palace ","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg","634","0","109","118","0","280","0","1034","2008-10-27T11:13:51-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.14050D94E28135C894625317C63D6C74","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","14050D94E28135C894625317C63D6C74","186390","Guildford, United Kingdom","Merrowmum","en","false","2023-03-29T09:09:46-04:00","4","We visited Pena Palace on a daytrip to Sintra while in Lisbon.  First of all, make sure you get tickets ahead of time on their website.  We arrived early for our timed entry and the line to buy tickets was very long.  Also, you have to get timed tickets and you must arrive at your time, there apparently is no allowance for people who are late.  We arrived at 9:40 for our 10:00 entrance and were the first in line waiting for the 10AM entry.  The park and the outside of the palace are gorgeous.  There are tons of paths and areas to walk around and the nature and birdwatching here is great.  The outside of the palace is very picturesque and the view (when the fog is not there) are stunning.  The inside of the palace was very underwhelming.  You shuffle in line from room to room and there was nothing really mindblowing about it (not like other palaces we've visited).  If I was to recommend it, I'd recommend only buying a park ticket to see the park and the outside of the palace, and skip the inside of the palace ticket.","Worth the visit on a day trip to Sintra, the outside visit is better than the inside","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/8e/e0/a9/geoff-y.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/8e/e0/a9/geoff-y.jpg","64","0","73","23","7","67","0","154","2012-08-14T13:14:42-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F1654D25DAC25A74334F31BCD2648B1","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F1654D25DAC25A74334F31BCD2648B1","53426","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania","GeoffY933","en","false","2023-03-28T13:11:02-04:00","1","We booked to enter at 1:00 pm.

We booked the tickets online when we got there, and had to wait about 1.5 hours for an entry slot (we got some food at the cafe while we waited, but it was pretty poor food).  I was quite underwhelmed by the castle.  It had some decent views but it's a long way to travel for that, and the castle isn't hugely interesting.  I wouldn't advice anyone to bother with this trip unless they have a real interest in the castle.  We came out to a torrential rain storm, so we got a motor bike carriage ride down the hill, sharing with two other people to keep the cost down.

This time we got an Uber direct from our hotel in Estoril to the Palace gates for only 13 euro. We had pre-booked times the day before and arrived in plenty of time so had a walk up to the High Cross beforehand.  Queue's were being well monitored and we only waited 30 minutes to get in at 1.30 slot. The rooms inside the castle are well furnished and very interesting with good info on the history and use of the  building. The views of the surrounding countryside are amazing. The gardens are more of a managed forest area but probably worth walking down through The Valley of the Lakes on leaving the castle which gets you back to the entrance. There was a bit of a wait for an Uber to take us back to Estoril as clearly not keen to come round that hairpin road but after 30 mins we got one for only 11 euro.

To our dismay on arrival we found out Pena palace was an uphill 75 minute walk. We were continually bombarded by tuktuk drivers with whisperings of strikes and palace closure. They are just after our money we said, and stormed on off uphill. Many minutes passed, no sign of the palace, only path closures forcing us into the arms of a friendly tuktuk driver. The palace will be open at 1pm let me take you he said, and charged us 20€ for the privilege (nearly cost my travel health insurance too may I add). My god have I never seen a queue so huge and gates so firmly closed. Tourists swarming like flies to a cow pat, clueless of the torture they were about to endure. However, I did not see failure as an option, only determination to overcome this challenge. This was to my detriment. One hour of queuing later the gates did open, we thought we’d made it. Oh how wrong we were. A further 30 minute walk uphill through the holy gates, we were struck by yet another queue. This crowd was angrier. Playing dirty. Cutting in. What has happened to us as a human race? Head strong, knees and backs weak, we stubbornly stood in that queue for another 2 hours. In too deep. The paracetamols took no effect. My poor sister was so grumpy she wouldn’t duet high school musical with me. Times were dark. The colourful turrets began to emerge through the trees, restoring hope. How long did it take you to walk around the palace I hear you ask? Alas, it was 15 minutes. Some may argue this is long enough, I’ll leave that with you to decide.

After taking the train to sintra, the 434 bus attendant tried to pressure us into buying a 24 hour ticket for €12 instead of giving us all the options as a single ticket existed for €4.10. And when we said we wanted that he became rude. We paid the €4.10 as that was all we needed since we were only going to the Peña palace not jumping off anywhere else. The journey was uncomfortable and cramped on the bus, but this was to be expected. 

The ticket then for the palace was €14 each which we paid expecting the grounds and palace to easily be worth it given all the hype the place receives. But the palace once inside was a little underwhelming as you couldn’t go into many rooms and were constantly being pressured to keep moving by how many people were behind you so you only saw things briefly.  The views from the walls however were impressive. 

The grounds though were the  most disappointing thing. There were barely any signposts and the German map/ phone map and distance markers made no sense for what was actually in front of your eyes. We got asked for directions a lot and even we had no clue. They need more signposts, or markers, or maps that actually show ALL the paths. A clearer/recommended route for easy medium and hard walk levels with rough times it will take would be good too as we were so lost at times we barely saw anything and we were wandering for ages. I also had to laugh because some of the tracks were severely steep even for me in my 20’s, yet I heard an attendant say most routes were handicap accessible. Even the castle was not. It had lots of stairs and a one way system that would have forced people to use them. 

We managed to negotiate a €5 each taxi down to the station afterwards with other people so the ride back wasn’t as unpleasant as the 434. Thank god we didn’t buy the all day ticket for 12. To summarise you pay €20-30 for the trip and receive confusion, rude attendants, cramped busses, and steep hills, all for about five minutes with a nice view.

Maybe go once if you want, but avoid peak times in the summer or this will be much much worse than this review.","Sintra disappointment","2023-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","2","0","3","2023-03-04T10:19:40-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.DE3D4C8E25B4CBF9B4B27C1BB45AA4DA","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","DE3D4C8E25B4CBF9B4B27C1BB45AA4DA",,,"D5399YIemilyp","en","false","2023-02-28T09:41:02-05:00","5","Such a beautiful spot.

It looked fabulous. The grounds looked very nice, too. Sometimes the pictures make a place look better. Sometimes worse. This time reality exceeded the picture. The exterior is boldly colorful, but not garish, like Pena. When you walk up to it and see it for the first time, you nod your head and say to yourself,”Yep, they nailed it.” The design is imposing.  Very impressive, inside and out, even though the inside is somewhat limited in space, less than you would imagine.  The house actually feels like a real house, like a family would really live there, a real family. It has a Moorish theme and it’s carried off very well. They have a sort of deck around most, if not all the house. It’s nice to walk and look at the surroundings. There are plenty of pathways to walk around. We only walked, pretty much, from the entrance to the house with a minute detour or two. If we had more time, I definitely would have taken advantage of more, as it is a very pleasant atmosphere and I could see visiting if I lived around there just to walk the grounds, Finally, the cafe was closed, perhaps permanently. So we had to go with sandwiches and hot chocolate from vending machines they had there. Both were surprisingly good. The sandwich was on a soft sub shaped roll with a small amount, I think. Not gourmet, but sufficiently filling with the addition of a bag of cookies I shared with my wife. At 2 euros, it was a good deal. My wife agreed. By the way, the bathrooms by the machine were clean, modern and functional.","Beautiful Palace, Beautiful Grounds","2022-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","379","0","120","116","9","117","0","613","2006-10-10T22:21:02-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6A194774CE98DF318E53CC34B3FB93F7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","6A194774CE98DF318E53CC34B3FB93F7",,"Virginia","JJJC_Family","en","false","2022-10-12T07:39:43-04:00","4","The palace holds little of interest except for the architecture and the astonishing interior.

The “castle” or more correctly the private residence of a wealthy industrialist has had a chequered history over the centuries and today has been fully restored.

The gardens that surround the castle are well worth a visit on their own and wind through landscaped and rough design alike

If you are driving, the GPS navigation we were using directed us to the N247 out of Sintra. We learned this takes you to the rear locked service entrance of the property. No access is available here. Monserrate is reached using the N375 and the entrance is clearly marked on the road. The GPS may indicate an entrance before you reach the public entrance. Proceed on to the main entrance, well-marked and there is parking available at this point.

It is well worth the visit.

I couldn’t believe there was another fantastic palace to visit in Sintra, albeit a few miles outside. 
This one is more like a mansion than a palace in terms of size, but they were definitely going for palace in terms of decoration. 
Like most of the sights in Sintra, this one is largely unfurnished, for reasons which are explained inside. 
If the gift shop is closed, the attendant will just be at lunch. Come back later. 
Of course, it’s perched on top of a hill and surrounded by mature vegetation (tall trees), so take a drone (if they’re allowed; I have no idea) if you want a good photo of the place.","Architecturally exuberant formerly private palace.",,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/8b/21/7c/andrew-nicola-d.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/8b/21/7c/andrew-nicola-d.jpg","92","0","5","33","0","52","0","177","2010-06-14T16:40:49-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.9528CB6E41A86BDFA9E0C277F4437C82","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","9528CB6E41A86BDFA9E0C277F4437C82","187849","Milan, Italy","andrewdA5102RT","47","Sights & Landmarks","57","Nature & Parks",,,,,,,,,,,"#4 of 72 things to do in Sintra","3","Architectural Buildings","70","Parks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189164-d953163-Reviews-Parque_e_Palacio_de_Monserrate-Sintra_Sintra_Municipality_Lisbon_District_Central_.html","http://www.parquesdesintra.pt/area-comercial/aluguer-de-espacos/palacio-de-monserrate/","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189164-d953163-Parque_e_Palacio_de_Monserrate-Sintra_Sintra_Municipality_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html"

They look like small castles, complete with turrets. Clearly someone had a taste for the whimsical. 
There’s an almost secret garden feeling about this part of the park. The lake is still and serene with dappled sunlight and reflections playing across the water. Lush greenery and ferns surround the lake and large snowy white swans nest along the banks. The whole thing is quite romantic and fanciful. 
The Pena Palace grounds are so extensive, with so many paths and grottos, that it would be easy to miss the lake. To find it, meander slowly down towards the lower exit gate (downhill from the ticket booths).","A Taste for the Whimsical","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2019-11-17T04:22:11-05:00","4","Yes this could be a typical English quirky stately home addition - a stately castle just for ducks - so unusual - see photos ","Great and Quirky","2019-11","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/da/6a/8c/badmintontim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/da/6a/8c/badmintontim.jpg","1511","0","361","74","1450","1064","0","2649","2012-03-21T06:46:36-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.48C9C725442793B98963A3BBE9DB2D26","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","48C9C725442793B98963A3BBE9DB2D26","186274","Hastings, United Kingdom","badmintontim","en","false","2019-08-17T06:36:58-04:00","5","Just when you think you won't find more beauty, you come across the dams of Pena.

The Chalet was built by King Ferdinand II and his second wife Elise Hensler, Countess of Edla, between 1864 and 1869, in keeping with the Alpine chalet model that was in vogue in Europe at that time. The building is extremely picturesque, characterised by the horizontal marking of the external plaster, painted to imitate timber cladding, and by the extensive use of cork as a decorative element, covering door and window frames, eaves and verandas, as well as tree trunks backing onto the facades to support climbing plants.",,,"eu.portugal","info@parquesdesintra.pt",,"Europe/Lisbon","1080","600","1080","600","1080","600","1080","600","1080","600","1080","600","1080","600","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/c7/2d/c2/photo2jpg.jpg","false","false","false","false","38.78542","4003980","Sintra, Sintra Municipality, Lisbon District, Central Portugal","none","-9.399805",,"Chalet da Condessa D’Edla",,,"241","true","true","$0.40",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/73/df/6b.jpg","","Viator","$305.04","Private Sightseeing Tours","6883P5","$306","Mystic Sintra Private Tour: Best Day Trip From Lisbon","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FLisbon%2FMystic-Sintra-Private-Tour-Best-Day-Trip-From-Lisbon%2Fd538-6883P5%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=22c55b1168a83cfed&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=4003980&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/06/73/30/95.jpg","","Viator","$72.10","Cultural Tours","66391P6","$73","Sintra & Cascais Tours","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FLisbon%2FSintra-and-Cascais-Tours%2Fd538-66391P6%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=b4ff67eccfaa79045&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=2&cnt=1&geo=4003980&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0b/1f/d1/92.jpg","","Viator","$36.05","Adrenaline & Extreme","156721P4","$37","Sintra Heritage and Nature Tour E-CAR GPS audio-guided route","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FSintra%2FSintra-Heritage-and-Nature%2Fd50861-156721P4%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=41ecf020cc110479a&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=3&cnt=1&geo=4003980&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0a/76/1f/23.jpg","","Viator","$249.57","Cultural Tours","66391P12","$250","Sintra & Cascais Private Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FLisbon%2FSintra-and-Cascais-Private-Tour%2Fd538-66391P12%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=a3b850797dfbee313&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=4&cnt=1&geo=4003980&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0a/76/28/5a.jpg","","Viator","$249.57","Cultural Tours","66391P13","$250","Sintra & Roca Cape Private Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FSintra%2FSintra-and-Roca-Cape-Private-Tour%2Fd50861-66391P13%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=317ebe085bc1a6184&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=5&cnt=1&geo=4003980&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true","Closed Now","Sintra","+351 21 923 7300","","0","382152130","413","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/c7/2d/c2/photo2jpg.jpg","550","188","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/16/c7/2d/c2/photo2jpg.jpg","250","960","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/c7/2d/c2/photo2jpg.jpg","1280","150","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/c7/2d/c2/photo2jpg.jpg","150","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/c7/2d/c2/photo2jpg.jpg","50","false","2019-03-13T10:44:58-0400","2019-03-13T10:44:58-0400",,"0","user",,"default","#18 of 72 things to do in Sintra","attraction","72","Sintra","189164","18","#18 of 72 things to do in Sintra","4.0","3.5268092155456543","en","false","2020-09-02T12:22:24-04:00","4","Although you have to pay the entry fee into the Pena Park and make a bit of a trek to visit the Chalet, its certainly worth it.

In the windows it shows notable news makers including Pope Francis, Nelson Mandela and the American and Chinese Presidents.

Over a few floors it presents a multitude of exhibits, both domestic and International, on news, media and communications. A great feature is a spiral staircase that features a news occurrence at each turn of the spiral. 

From the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the 1966 unveiling of the Tagus bridge through to the Bosnian wars, all are captivatingly covered.

A Gestetner duplicator is on view, with the legend that it was one of the symbols of press freedom. 

Also shown is a vinyl record player and an array of TV cameras. A poster illustrates the 1960 American Presidential candidates, Kennedy and Nixon; the first television election.","Fascinating, informative and important","2019-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/97/ed/67/permia.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/97/ed/67/permia.jpg","3053","0","324","81","20051","541","0","3676","2006-08-30T17:27:06-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6CEAD20CEAA37AFB28EA1D16E38937C5","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","6CEAD20CEAA37AFB28EA1D16E38937C5",,"Ireland","permia","en","false","2019-01-04T03:45:11-05:00","5","This museum was bare random in terms of location but it's one of the best museums we have visited ... critical approach to the media with 3 floors of analysis ...

It is not the largest museum for sure, but it is exceptionally clean, you can get very close to the aircraft to take photos and there are certainly some aircraft we had not seen before.  Best was the knowledge of the service member who was at some of the planes.  To enter the plane, you needed the service member to let you in.  The person that was working the day we went was exceptionally knowledgeable and told lots of interesting facts about the the planes.  The whole experience was very relaxed and pleasant.  Bonus - only 3 Euro/person

Tip:  We took public transport. From Lisbon - take the train to Portela de Sintra.  This is the stop before Sintra.  When you exit from the train, go right and come up to where the buses are.  These buses go to many different places. You will want the Mafrense green and white bus second shelter/stop from the start of the bus shelters/stop.  The bus driver sold us a return ticket (total for both ways was 3,80 Euro/person) and you get off at the Facao stop (there is a big plane there) and walk 5-8 min down the road to the museum. The bus driver also gave us a timetable and circled the times when the bus would arrive at Facao for our return trip. For reference, we took the 10:35 am bus to the museum and the 1:16 pm bus at Facao.  Probably a bit long for the museum - but the buses don't run super frequently.  Bring a lunch/snack - there are tables in a small cafeteria area in the museum.","Excellent displays","2019-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/56/c6/ae/katgreen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/56/c6/ae/katgreen.jpg","40","0","94","71","72","46","0","157","2007-08-09T14:23:27-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F7B1515C4DD9041DDA7A1DCF0683C60E","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","F7B1515C4DD9041DDA7A1DCF0683C60E","60859","Madison, Wisconsin","katgreen","en","false","2019-07-03T12:57:23-04:00","5","Great collection of Portuguese warplanes and a thorough timeline of TAP Air Portugal’s history (Portuguese commercial aviation history).

They have many old and new planes, some helicopters and many engines and turbine configurations. More impressive was Jorge Fernandez (staff of the air museum) who explained all the details and answered all my questions. Jorge also showed us around the planes of the museum.

If you have an interest in aircrafts you should go and visit this museum, it's a must, because they have a great collection and staff and they charge just 3 Euros entry.","Great Visit of Air Museum in Sintra","2019-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2011-06-03T06:56:10-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B06E84ED418C3B28220EA5821C54B34A","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","B06E84ED418C3B28220EA5821C54B34A",,,"Nomad295277","en","false","2019-01-22T04:35:46-05:00","5","The museum is about 30 minutes out of Lisbon and best reached by car.
The museum is well sign posted and easy to find, plenty of parking for cars and coaches. Entry is €3 or €1 for kids/seniors. 

The collection is mainly 2 hangars, with a wide modern and past collection of aircraft. Showing both commercial and military helicopters and planes. It has Air Force and TAP exhibits.

If you want to go inside the DC3 or the 707 you have to ask at the reception desk and someone will escort you inside. This is between 10am and 11.30am and again for a period in the evening. I asked to go inside however as there was a school tour there at the same time there was no one available to escort me inside the planes.

Also they have someone planes outside to visit again these must be escorted visits.

As well as showing aircraft`s, it has history about Portuguese airports, TAP uniforms and all the history.

There are plenty of clean toilets dotted around and a cafe although this was closed on a January morning. There is a small gift shop as well which is manned by the reception, anything you want to buy you must ask the reception. 

Any aviation enthusiast must visit especially for just €3.","Well worth a visit","2019-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","13","0","3","13","4","7","0","33","2011-09-13T07:25:21-0400","Lucy","C","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.5D8C2913EAB30CDAAAD498FE627BE098","en_UK","0","Lucy C","0",,"user","5D8C2913EAB30CDAAAD498FE627BE098","186411","Leeds, United Kingdom","Lucy C","en","false","2018-12-13T07:29:15-05:00","4","The Portuguese Air Force has always been a relatively small organisation, and is currently facing some serious financial challenges.  Thus it is heartening to visit such an immaculate collection that celebrates the nation’s aviation heritage.

Located at Air Base #1 at Sintra , some 30 minutes from downtown Lisbon, the museum is a bit off the beaten track but well worth the effort.  Free parking, €3.00 entry for an adult (plus concessions) makes it fantastic value.  Guided visits are available on request, and audio guides can be provided.

The majority of the collection is held within two main hangars, one holding a large number of iconic types that have been central to Portugal’s military and civil aviation history.  A second, slightly smaller hangar, is actually formed from three historic buildings dating back to the 1920s and focuses on light aviation, foreign military campaigns and advanced jet training and VIP aircraft.

The aircraft are immaculately presented and while many carry typical examples of weapons, larger transport are displayed with doors or hatches open to enable the visitor to see inside.  The hangar walls are covered in interpretation boards, though only in Portuguese, although some of the aircraft interpretation boards have English translation.

There is a cafe (though closed, perhaps they don’t get enough visitors in December), and a small shop.

If you harbour an interest in aviation, this is a must.  Great for kids too.  Most definitely recommended!","Immaculate Collection ","2018-12","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0d/8b/8f/b9/theaviator0765.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0d/8b/8f/b9/theaviator0765.jpg","89","0","0","53","31","161","0","303","2016-11-06T07:29:21-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.39026A49166EF9F2B7744EF29CF19079","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","39026A49166EF9F2B7744EF29CF19079","209973","Ripon, United Kingdom","TheAviator0765","en","false","2018-12-10T03:00:24-05:00","5","A beautiful museum with rare airplanes, explaining the history of portugese aviation.

At one end of the beach there is a huge sea water swimming pool which belongs to a hotel but it is open, for a fee, for others to use. There are indeed steps up to the cliff top at the opposite end of the beach to the swimming pool. However, these are closed due to a construction problem with the steps. There is another way up to the main road and thus onwards to the coastal path which is by the small roundabout just by the end of the road along the beach.

I like the cliffs, the waves and the sunset. You can go up the stairs in the cliffs and see the dinossaur footstep. From up there you can walk all the way to Cabo da Roca. You also can walk in the other direction to Praia das Maçãs, Azenhas, Magoito, Samarra, all the way to Ericeira.

You also have an amazing swimming pool with 100 meters, perfect to swim.

Good beach to learn to surf and bodyboard. But better for low tide, especially for beginners. Lots of schools to choose.

Lots of good restaurants, Bar do Fundo, Angra, Galé, right on top of the beach. 

The not so good points is the weather is quite unstable. You can get really foggy and cold days in the summer. The sea is cold, rough and strong but a lot of fun. With low tide is better.","Great beach, big waves, big cliffs, great restaurants, great sunshine","2019-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","36","0","0","14","34","48","0","98","2011-01-04T03:54:42-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.3997A4DD3F9D95F01E8B353167024DA7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","3997A4DD3F9D95F01E8B353167024DA7","189158","Lisbon, Portugal","TRVR77","en","false","2019-07-13T18:06:50-04:00","5","A nice drive west from Sintra and the signs lead you to Praia Grande.

The property has been a hotel and private residency and makes for an attractive building which can be viewed from the town by looking up towards the castle. 

If you take the hiking trail between the castle and/or Park of Pena down to the the city centre, you'll pass Vila Sassetti. The garden grounds here are very well manicured and the villa is a delightful property to look over from the outside. Not sure if the property is open for public at times of the year or if you can only view the villa from the outside.

Note: There is a small detached cafe at Vila Sassetti if you want to stop for a cup of coffee and/or cake.","Lombard style villa between the city centre and Moorish Castle","2016-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/ed/b7/59/bradjill.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/ed/b7/59/bradjill.jpg","6620","0","9176","304","73989","3561","0","10499","2009-06-21T01:58:25-0400","BradJill","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2501C1251BE10E5BF6395D4FCD7FCBBD","en_US","0","BradJill T","0",,"user","2501C1251BE10E5BF6395D4FCD7FCBBD","294217","Hong Kong, China","BradJill T","en","false","2016-06-29T23:59:10-04:00","5","We took advantage of the new hiking trail from the Moors Castle down to town.

I’d recommend doing battle with the crowds and seeing the palace first, then unwind by meandering through these extensive and relatively peaceful gardens.
The Vale dos Lagos (Valley of the Lakes) is a particularly pretty part which starts just below the palace and runs gently downhill towards the lower exit gates.  The lakes are a series of small man-made ponds, rather than great lakes but as you stroll beside them, you’ll see fish, snowy white geese, a lush entanglement of greenery, ferns and mossy walls and grottoes. An unexpected delight towards the end is a number of charming duck-houses. Sitting in the middle of the lake, they look like small castles, complete with turrets. Clearly someone had a taste for the whimsical. 
If you are exiting the park at this point, you are right beside a bus-stop and across the road are the trail heads for the Sasetti and the Santa Maria hiking trails.","Romantic Garden Walk through Valley of the Lakes","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2020-02-22T11:20:05-05:00","5","In the rush to see the major landmarks of Sintra, it's easy to 'do' the Palace of Pena, hot-foot it across to the Moorish Castle and then onto the next stop on your itinerary. If you do, you'll be missing one of the highlights of the Sintra Hills.

The Parque de Pena and the Vale dos Lagos within it have a fairytale-like quality, with its towering trees, dainty bridges, chain of lakes and mini waterfalls, lush green ferns, tiny chapel, moss-covered benches and other man-made structures being slowly consumed by the undergrowth. And despite the crazy number of people at the palace, the size of the park and its labyrinthine paths make it easy to lose yourself in this beautiful setting. We wandered around for an hour and didn't see a soul for 20 minutes of that time.

The station was built 1887 and has a simple but attractive exterior along with a small interior with walls lined with azulejos tiled artworks. 

You can purchase tickets at the self-service machine within the station, at the ticket booth when open as well as a self-service machine at the end of the two platforms where there is also an station entrance. 

If connecting to/from Lisbon airport, you can use rail service between Oriente and Sintra Stations. Service is fairly regular and takes around 1 hour. Otherwise, if you are travelling from within Lisbon, you are more likely to use service to/from Rossio Station which takes around 40 minutes. 

There are several tourist buses which start just outside the rail station taking passengers to various palaces and gardens located dotting the hillsides above the Historic Centre of Sintra. You can also find taxi and uber drivers with ease as well. There are several casual espresso bars and eateries on the street just outside the rail station if you need to wait a few minutes for our outbound train back to Lisbon.","Simple station east of the Historic Centre of Sintra","2023-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/ed/b7/59/bradjill.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/ed/b7/59/bradjill.jpg","6620","0","9176","304","73989","3561","0","10499","2009-06-21T01:58:25-0400","BradJill","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2501C1251BE10E5BF6395D4FCD7FCBBD","en_US","0","BradJill T","0",,"user","2501C1251BE10E5BF6395D4FCD7FCBBD","294217","Hong Kong, China","BradJill T","en","false","2023-04-03T07:35:18-04:00","1","Would advise anyone NOT to park here.

It was simple and cheap and the train station is only a 10 min walk from the town. My best tip is to save Sintra for a day when you can make an early start and then head to the Pena Palace first. 
TIPS:
* We caught the train from Rossio Station, using a rechargeable Via Viagem card (€4.50 return). It’s a 40 min trip from Lisbon.
* Trains are frequent and run every 10 min in peak times (20 or 30 min at other times)
* We arrived at Sintra Station around 10am which was later than we’d intended. In hindsight, arriving an hour earlier would have made a big difference.  
* The station is small and therefore is easy to find your way around.
* As you exit the station, head to your right to go straight to the 434 Scotturb buses which do a constant loop from the station to Pena Palace and the Castle (€3.90 & €6.90 for hop on/off). 
* Importantly, your Via Viagem card won’t work on the Sintra buses. 
* From the station, tuk tuks or ubers are another option to get to the palace and castle and there are hiking trails too (very steep). 
* The town centre is only a 10 min walk from the train station. If going here first, then head away from the buses and head downhill until you get to the palace-like Town Hall. Turn left here and follow the Volta do Duche road into town which is a very easy pleasant walk.","Planning A Day Trip to Sintra...","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2020-09-29T15:28:32-04:00","4","It is actually a small train station, however, there is an information and ticket office in the hall.

As far as town halls go, this is an extravagant one. Built in 1909, its fanciful architecture features towers, faux battlements, green, white and gold glazed spires and stylised arched windows. The fairy-tale appearance seems at odds with the ordinary, mundane matters of local transport, housing, sanitation and land use that goes on inside and because it is a working building, it’s not open to the public. 
The tall coloumn out the front is a pelourinho or pillory. Back in the day, law-breakers were punished by being tied to the base of these columns and publicly humiliated – an old school version of naming and shaming. 
If you continue the walk into Sintra’s historic centre, you will also pass a series of sculptures and artworks along the roadside and an enormous Moorish fountain.","Fairytale Town Hall","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2020-02-22T10:53:59-05:00","4","In a town overflowing with spectacular, often ostentatious architecture, even the city hall couldn't resist getting in on the act.

The Serra de Sintra mountains start in the centre of the old town and extend to the ocean at Cabo da Roca, the western-most point of mainland Europe. 
Even if, like us, you only have a day-trip to Sintra, there are still hiking trails between the palaces and castle that allow you to see something of the mountains. 
After visiting Pena Palace, we followed the bushland trail to the Moors Castle and then continued the mountain trail around the outer castle walls, following the path right down through the forest to the old town centre. It was almost entirely downhill so was very easy.
We joined the track from the carpark opposite the lower Pena Park gate (the Lakes entrance). 
The path here was just a simple bushland track and there was a little bit of scrambling involved. We weren’t always 100% certain that we were still on the right path but we followed the general direction of the castle and emerged at the right spot (the outer walls of the castle beside the road, a kiosk and a toilet block). From here the route became much clearer, there were occasional signs and the path was mostly paved or cobbled. There are some great panoramic views as you descend and you will also pass the 12th century Gothic church of Santa Maria. 
The walk took us under an hour but we walked at a leisurely pace, stopping to look at the views.
TIPS
 * The Tourist Information Centre map was somewhat helpful as a general guide. If you don't already have a better map, then I’d recommend picking this up before you go because neither the Palace Gift shop nor the ticket office had any maps.
* Look out for wooden signs and trail markers that are red and yellow lines painted on a walls, rocks or tree. 
* there was plenty of shade and you didn't need special hiking shoes, just comfortable walking shoes or trainers but do take a bottle of water with you.","Exploring Sintra Beyond the Pena Palace.....","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2019-08-27T10:48:46-04:00","5","If you want to enjoy the Sintra Hills/Mountains you should spend at least 2 days.

I would categorized this place as must-see place, but with just couple of minutes stay.

It looks centuries old but surprisingly it’s nowhere near as as old as it looks and was only built in 1922. However the revivalist design harks back to 13th/14th century Moorish architecture with an exaggerated arabesque style. The entrance is formed by three large horse-shoe arches and it’s covered in the highly decorative and traditional azulejos tiles.

We bought our tickets from the self serve machine which gave no option to purchase a family ticket, which was €26. They do sell these at the manned ticket booths and online.  It’s also worth noting that there is a ticket booth at the immediate entrance to the castle as well as at the outer walls so if there are long queues it’s worth walking inside to buy your tickets.

Having decided to open it for the general public as place to relax and walk around one would expect some kind of information about the place, as well as services like food stands or games for kids. In fact there is nothing besides a grand old house which is closed to the public and some large gardens to visit. Public ways have been made for people to wander around but in the end nothing really stands besides the size of the place and its buildings.","Good idea to open for the public but still not much to do","2015-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/1a/4d/1c/polskiman.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/1a/4d/1c/polskiman.jpg","120","0","268","50","28","287","0","457","2008-06-02T14:20:13-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.3F5AAF4F7D4117FF6CC56D3D46F84743","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","3F5AAF4F7D4117FF6CC56D3D46F84743","189164","Sintra, Portugal","Polskiman","en","false","2015-05-19T10:26:47-04:00","4","If you like to find places that only a few ever heard of, this is the place (or should i say Palace...) to go!

Solar de Ribafria ordered the construction in 1541, in the reign of D. Manuel I.

It's name, Ribafria is due to Lordship of Ribafria, who was allowed to gave his nickname to the property.

The Palace was designed with straith and sober lines and it's consider a fine example of portuguese ""Manuelino"" architecture style.
From the Palace structure, a 30 metter (100 ft) quadrangular tower stands out from the building. It's said that it was meant to watch the sea and all the surroundings that belonged to the same Ribafria Lordship.
Facing the Palace it's possible to see, in the right upper side, the coat of arms (in stone). It's shape is peculiar because it looks like it's gonna fall from the corner...

The Palace have, in front of it, a great water mirror that ""builts"" a reflection of its magnificent frontage.

Convolving this scenery, luxuriants tall trees provide the shadow for a perfect walk (romantic, family and even with a adventure felling).

Another curiosity it's the XVI century ""swimming pool"". It's a must!!

And, of course, the small chappel.

I hope all this tips will make you visit this Palace that is suffering a structural renovation that will allow it to be an hotel in the near future.

You should go by car, as no public transport will get you even close to this place. By car, it is a 20 minute drive from Sintra and an hour drive from Lisbon. You can park there, there is a lot of space, and then you have to walk in a steep road for maybe 5-7 minutes until the top, where you can reach this stunning place. From the top you can see all the coastline until the Espichel cape, and also you have a beautiful forest scenery to the other side of this convent. A lot of stairs in the convent as well, it is closed, but the views from the outside are gorgeous. It is always a bit windy up there, so if you have kids better to cover them in scarfs and winter caps, otherwise they will get very cold. Usually the weather is very uncertain over there, sunny for 10 minutes, and windy and cloudy for half an hour. When it is very cloudy, you cannot enjoy the views completely, but you can always see something, and this something is already magnificent. 
Comfy shoes are a must! :) and then, you can take a look around the trails as well. It is a very romantic spot, and it is never crowded :) so you can really enjoy the views!","Breathtaking views wherever you look","2018-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/11/7d/bf/54/theeutraveler.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/7d/bf/54/theeutraveler.jpg","26","0","0","19","0","20","0","66","2017-07-12T09:20:18-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7FDF639FC2B97B3AE24794CFD98BE7D1","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7FDF639FC2B97B3AE24794CFD98BE7D1","274967","Riga, Latvia","2EUtravellers","en","false","2017-12-27T03:21:31-05:00","5","Now that I know about this place, I will bring friends and family who visit here instead of braving the hordes at Pena Palace.

It was closed when I visited it.
Facing the ocean you can see at your right Cabo da Roca, the most occidental point in continental Europe,  and the light house, for the left the extensive coastal line until Cascais. A beautiful view to the ocean or to Sintra Woods, depending to where you look. 
The convent was closed so you just can walk around. A little bit windy. Some meters west you can find the Ermida de S. Saturnino (St. Saturnino Hermitage), in disrepair unfortunately.  A building from XVI and XVII centuries, but a more ancient worship place (a previous building was demolished to give place to the actual chapel; the place was, supposedly, founded by a companion of Portugal's first king). During a part of XX century was used as a house or barn.
Archaeological excavations also found a necropolis from  XII-XV centuries and the remains of other buildings, like a cistern.
The wood surrounding is really pleasant and some hike trails are signed.
You can walk from Sintra; It took me around 3-4 hours walking. From here you can go down to Cabo da Roca walking through the paths on the forest (not signed, which can be tricky).   

You can find some information about the sanctuary when you approach the place (at least in portuguese).","Great view","2014-05","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","7","0","3","1","0","2","0","10","2014-01-14T17:46:37-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FBE0577399B5D1D2F61616E235999550","pt_PT","0",,"0",,"user","FBE0577399B5D1D2F61616E235999550","188049","Basel, Switzerland","FiMig","en","false","2013-10-07T05:37:28-04:00","4","From here you can best see Cascais from top to the south. To the west you can see Cabo de Roca, the westernmost point in continental Europe. The small church was closed and there is not too much to do except enjoying the view. There is no fee to access the place. The woods are quite nice, humid and special, with their own microclimate. You can expect to be a little windy. You can trail a little around, but get a GPS so you wont get lost, the forest can be tricky and the paths are not well marked. The parking is limited so you may have to park in the woods and the access road is thin so drive slow.","One of the best panoramas in Sintra and Lisbon region.","2013-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/b3/56/f2/valugi.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/b3/56/f2/valugi.jpg","26","0","34","20","63","10","0","57","2008-10-21T06:49:07-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D9DEF56E415B0C95F8DD4C2DB64181C9","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","D9DEF56E415B0C95F8DD4C2DB64181C9",,"Tromso, Norway","valugi","fr","false","2023-02-19T07:41:41-05:00","4","Après avoir parcouru 3/4 kms en voiture vous bifurquez sur la droite dans un petit chemin de terre (carrossable c'est à noter) et un parking (non surveillé) permet de se garer facilement.

She explained the history of the museum, layout and exhibitions to us in French (I did French for 4 years at school so managed to catch about 50% of what she was saying). 
The first floor had a film and some beautiful pictures of space. Unfortunately we were hurried downstairs by one of the guides, even though we hadn't finished looking around. He only spoke Portuguese so I don't know why we were made to leave. 
The second floor was split into different areas which coincided with what time period the fossils were from. It was hard to distinguish which fossils were what as the numbered explanations did not match up and were often in the wrong place. We were also under the impression that some of the fossils were actually replicas, but this was hard to tell as most of the explanations were in Portuguese.

He wanted to be buried in Sintra and in the museum there is an unopened box of love letters that he asked to be kept closed until 2050.

One such fountain is called Fonte dos Piscoes (1931). It is located along Ave. Almeida Garret just a few minutes walk from the Quinta de Regaleira. 

Fonte dos Piscoes has a mostly light yellow colour with several sets of tiles including the centre pattern with blue and orange tiles along with a bas-reliefs of playful cherubs just above a single spout which spills water into a small basin just below and a larger on at ground level. 

During our recent visit water was pouring from the spout and spilling into a basin below, many visitors were topping up their water bottles, as did we. The fresh water tasted delicious.","Decorative fountain with delicious fresh water","2023-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/ed/b7/59/bradjill.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/ed/b7/59/bradjill.jpg","6620","0","9176","304","73989","3561","0","10499","2009-06-21T01:58:25-0400","BradJill","T","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.2501C1251BE10E5BF6395D4FCD7FCBBD","en_US","0","BradJill T","0",,"user","2501C1251BE10E5BF6395D4FCD7FCBBD","294217","Hong Kong, China","BradJill T","en","false","2021-01-06T06:20:42-05:00","5","Beautiful tiles, lovely spot for a photo.

In addition to the actual museum there are quite a few sculptures that have been placed along the Vulcha Dulche sidewalk as well.

This museum has re-opened its doors, after being closed for about seven years, in the late month of May, the 17th, this time to expose part of the large art collection of the Sintra municipality. This way, it's no longer just a museum of modern art but also of art from the XIX century. Being the oldest art works mainly figurative art of various Sintra idyllic landscapes.

I'm a volunteer tour guide at this museum on sundays, so I welcome all people here to know this fine art collection. 

The museum visit is indeed free for people under 17 or over 60 years old and for student cards holders.

They were always in a central place like in the main plaza or outside the town hall just like this one. Nowadays it looks like a decorative monument of some sort but back in the day, they had a very practical purpose. Criminals and other offenders were tied or chained to the base of the column and were often whipped. Some pillories still have the metal rings for tying prisoners up. The public location ensured maximum humiliation for the offender because there was no hiding. This was a medieval version of naming and shaming. 
This pillory has the typical feature of a highly decorative column. This one is entwined with rope-like sculptured patterning. At the top is an armillary sphere, with coats of arms and at the very pinnacle, a large cross of the Knights Templar.
This is the first sight you come to if you are walking from the train station into the old town. Continuing the walk into the historic centre, you will also pass a series of sculptures and artworks along the roadside and an enormous Moorish fountain.","Name & Shame","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2020-08-28T07:38:50-04:00","4","While strolling around Sintra, between the train station and the historic center of the town, you will certainly notice the town hall building.

The main features are the bell tower and an arched entry flanked by 6 slender columns which is the original Gothic portico. Originally there would have been a Gothic rose window above the portal but this was replaced at some later stage. The façade is saved from plainness by decorative stone scrolls and exposed stonework at the sides.

Dr. Franca is noted for being one of Portugal's most important scientists of the 20th century, having been credited with critical discoveries and treatment development in the field of bacteriology. 

The monument features a bronze bust depicting a middle-aged Franca in front of a medallion embedded into the monument just behind.

The entire gardens are a wonderful indulgence of lush plantings, secret grottoes and a labyrinth of paths. The fountain is tucked away in a shady, secluded spot and has the pleasingly romantic name of Fountain of Small Birds. There’s a bench seat nearby which was a very pleasant and quiet spot to sit for a while. Surprisingly, after the madness of the palace crowds, this part of the garden felt like our own private space. No-one else came near it.
The Islamic styled fountain has decoratively tiled walls and is topped with a golden dome that has Arabic inscriptions running around it. I couldn't see any information about the inscription but I later found out that it says “The Sultan D. Manuel built this chapel in the name of Our Lady Mary of Pena, in the year 1503, in celebration of the safe return of Dom Vasco da Gama’s discovery of the lands and countries which he found, the Cape of Good Hope and India. For His Highness the Sultan Ferdinand II, husband of Her Majesty Queen Maria II, built it with royal magnificence in the year 1840”.
Strangely the inscription refers to the King Ferdinand refers to himself as a Sultan. Im not sure why but Ferdinand clearly had a taste for whimsy and this was perhaps just another of his fanciful ideas.
From here, we walked past the Garden of Camellias and the most stunning magnolia trees, down through the Valley of the Lakes and finally to the lower exit.","Hidden Pavilion in the Pena Palace Gardens","2020-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg","1481","0","0","38","405","314","0","1833","2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2","186216","United Kingdom","Mairwen1","en","false","2016-07-22T17:43:42-04:00","3","One of the interesting things you can see within the grounds of the Park of Pena is the small Islamic pavilion known as the Fountain of the Small Birds situated between the Hot House and the Valley of the Lakes.

Of interest are the 3 16th century paintings, painted on wood panels as well as some very old frescos on the walls and ceiling. The altar definitely feels old.

Much of the wall decoration and ceiling decoration were done with painting instead of actual wood carving or gold-plated paint. 
There are plenty of chandeliers through out the palace - worth spending time to enjoy the details of each of them. 
The grounds were manicured beautifully, patterned after French gardens. Not as big in size - still very enjoyable !!

As our name indicates, our big bet is on Cultural Tourism in Sintra. We are located in front of the Train Station to make it easier for those visiting us. We have collaborators with great references, all from Sintra with a vast knowledge of its history and cultural landscape, all with the same Philosophy, Passion and Motivation, to provide those who visit us daily with a unique and sustainable way of strolling through the Beautiful Cultural Landscape from Sintra. Our fleet is made up of 100% electric vehicles such as E-cars, E-bikes and E-Scouters, with all the necessary conditions for those who visit us to feel the real Sintra!! E-cars, E-bikes and E-Scouters are perfect to escape the mass tourism that currently exists in Sintra, better than going on a Bus full of people, or taking a polluting Tuk Tuk.
