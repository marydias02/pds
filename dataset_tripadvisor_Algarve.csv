He did not speak at all outside of pointing out the sites but it's off season and there were 3 of us on the boat and we were quiet so no big deal there. 

When purchasing the ticket, I walked up the the stand and the lady there was super friendly and welcoming. She offered me a choice between the City Shoreline and the Benagil caves. I mentioned to her that I was staying in Armacao de Para and would be touring caves the next day and asked whether those were the same caves as the Benagil caves and she said no, it was something different, so I elected to go for the Benagil caves tour. When she tried to book me, it was already sold out and there would be no more tours for the day as they were only doing one tour a day since it was off season and there was not a lot of demand. So I went for the City Shoreline tour instead, and just selected the next available time which was in 20 mins.

Once I had paid, she said, don't miss the Benagil caves while I was here and I was closer to it since I was staying in Armacao de Pera - turns out the tour I  had already booked for the next day was the same thing... and seems like she was just trying to make a sale.

As per the lady's instructions, I headed to the boarding area to meet her colleague. Once I got to him, he mentioned that they had a requirement to have a minimum of 2 people per trip and since I was traveling alone, they were attempting to find other people for the timeslot to join me but if not, they would have to delay the trip and that his colleague had probably already mentioned this to me. She did not. Luckily they were able to find a couple to join on time and we were off. 

We had a pleasant tour along the shoreline but where back in under an hour, even though the tour is sold as a 1 hour 15 min experience. 

Once we came back, I tripped getting off the boat and fell but the guide did nothing. Stayed in his spot feet away from the boat and didn't even try to help me up or ask how I was. The random strangers who were on the boat with me helped and checked if I was ok...I get that current times require us to distance and be careful about contact but would have been nice if he at least asked of I needed assistance. 

Overall, I recommend the tour, but not the company. There were a lot of other companies providing the same tour so I would go with them instead.","Good tour, terrible tour company",2021-10,,en,false,2021-10-05T10:21:45-04:00,5,"Our trip for dolphin watching couldn’t be any better!

However, the overall atmosphere, especially nearing the end of the season, was uncomfortable and uninviting. The amount of staff overpowered the visitors and yet made little efforts to engage with any of us. Nobody seemed to care much, and the level of indifference created an awkward atmosphere. In addition, it was noticeable that they expected more work from their volunteers, who were being compensated far less with much more expectation to work and who were noticeably far more interactive with the guests. If not for these people, I would have wanted to leave early for feeling uncomfortable and out of place. I understand that it’s the end of season and people are tired and may not feeling like socializing with new guests that are coming and going, but unfortunately it affects the experience of people who are paying to come on their vacation and aren’t feeling very welcome.

Tridente Boat Trips operate from a stand directly in front of the Holiday Inn - Armação de Pêra - just at the end of the formal beach lounges with the sun shades.
We arrived to be greeted by the owner who was expecting us and made us feel welcome.
The boat itself must be quite new and was flawless in it’s appearance- obviously well maintained.  We were assisted with wearing our life jackets which were also well maintained and compact so not intrusive to wear.
Our ‘captain’ was Wagner Lopez who was friendly, helpful and spoke sufficient English to explain the various caves and point out other interesting facts.
Our tour lasted an hour - the first 45 minutes were spent winding in and out of coves to see the many amazing caves along the coast - it was close to high tide so there were a couple of caves that we couldn’t get totally inside but our adventure was certainly enhanced by Wagner’s expertise in navigating through the caves.  
Our favourite was the Captain’s cave - Benagil is the most spectacular but it’s also extremely popular.
We could not recommend Tridente Boat Trips more highly.
Our only regret was that we didn’t have more time to enjoy some of the other watersports they offer from the same location.

Schnell und unkompliziert wurden alle meine Fragen beantwortet und wir haben einen Flugtermin für den nächsten Tag ausgemacht.
Der Flugplatz liegt etwas versteckt im Naturschutzgebiet, war aber mit der Wegbeschreibung sehr gut zu finden.

Vor Ort durfte ich dabei sein, als der Gyrokopter für den Flug vorbereitet und überprüft wurde. Skyxpediton legt sehr viel Wert auf die Sicherheit und der Gyrokopter sah fast fabrikneu aus. Alle meine vielen, typisch männlich deutschen, technischen Fragen wurde mir vor und während des Fluges beantwortet.

Doch das wichtigste ist der Flug an sich. Ich habe bereits 10 Tage hier verbracht und dachte ich kenne die Landschaft, aber aus der Luft kann man die Schönheit erst richtig erkennen. Es war ein fantastisches Erlebnis über dem Naturschutzgebiet, von Via Real über Monto Gordo bis nach Tavira an den Stränden entlang über funkelndes Wasser, Salzbecken und an den Burgen vorbei.

Mum and Dad did a little internet research and could that Mike Raven, who runs the school with his wife, son & sheepdog Nelly is an British & European surf champion who had relocated to the Algarve from Cornwall in 2004.
We took the plunge, telephoned the school and talked to Mike’s wife Nicky about the classes, she explained everything to us and we decided as neither of us had any surfing experience to book the 1 day beginner session. 
Wow, from the time that we met Mike & the family on top of the cliffs above the beach we knew that we were in great hands, by halfway through the session we were both up on our feet and thoroughly enjoyed the whole day.
I can’t recommend Mike and his team highly enough.
ANYONE visiting the Algarve, from beginner upwards who wants to learn or improve their surfing should book with the Raven Surf School, the groups are small enough for loads of 1to1 tuition and for sure next time we are in Portugal we will be booking again.

They accepted to take us two on a one day notice which was a nice gesture. Mike was very nice throughout the entire session, gave us great advices and managed to easily handle our different levels. Mike’s wife took care of us like a mother which was super pleasant.

I can’t emphasize enough how spectacular and encouraging Mike was. He was in the water with us and would correct us each time. For those who struggled standing, he would physically get you started on the wave so you could just focus on getting up. 

Other Pros:
-The lesson starts early so you get the first choice of spots in Bordeira
-Max class size of 8
-Mike’s wife takes great photos of you so you can focus on the lesson
-Only about 20 minutes total on land for the theory and the rest of the day in the water 
-Earliest ending surf day (back by 3) so you can maximize time in Lagos. You’ll be tired anyway. I wouldn’t have wanted to do longer 
-Really authentic, family-run business complete with dog 

Cons:
-You have to carry your boards 10-15 minutes each way to the van (this beach is difficult to access for everyone)

The day started early but enabled Mike to get the best spot on the beach. Mike was very safety conscience with regards surfers in his group. 
Our prime recommendation if you are planning more than one day would be to leave a gap between lessons. Even at 15 and 17 our two children found it very tiring so a break to give their muscles time to recover was ideal!

Ursprünglich sollte es an einem Dienstag stattfinden musste aber kurzfristig wegen zu starkem Seegang abgesagt werden. Glücklicherweise konnten wir es auf den Sonntag ( unseren letzen Urlaubstag) schieben. 
Was soll ich sagen?! BESSER HÄTTE ES NICHT KOMMEN KÖNNEN!!!

Das Wetter und der Tag waren perfekt!

An Bord waren Fernando mit seinen zwei Crewmitgliedern und uns 18 Passagieren. 
Zu erst ging es motorisiert an eine Badestelle wo wir uns einige Zeit aufgehalten haben. wir durften sogar die bootseigene Musikbox kapern und unsere eigenen Lieder abspielen. Neben ein paar Salti und erfrischenden Getränken haben wir dort noch Tapas zum Abend gegessen. Alles wurde von Fernando frisch am Boot zubereitet und es war sehr lecker. Selbst für Vegetarier konnte was gezaubert werden. 
Anschließend ging es zwischen Felsen und steilen Klippen so nah dran vorbei, dass man sich wie auf der Titanic fühlte 

Danach ging es raus auf hohe See wo auch kurzerhand das Segel gespannt wurde. 
Das war schon ein Highlight für sich da hier alles per Hand gemacht wurde und die Besatzung schon gut ins schwitzen kam. Bei anderen Anbietern ist das wohl schon automatisiert und da fehlt dann einfach diese Action. 

Fernando hat es anhand der See und Wetterdaten so angepasst das wir zum perfekten Zeitpunkt ankamen und den Sonnenuntergang in vollen Zügen genießen konnten!
Das war der SCHÖNSTE Moment den wir (natürlich nach der Strandhochzeit) hatten.

From first email contact months ago to leaving the boat after the exam last week, I was impressed with this school.

Jules' administration leading up to the week was flexible and thorough.  After dates were agreed the money transfers were easy, and the pre-course information was timely and useful.

Rob was my instructor for the tough week of preparation.  Under Rob's instruction and the many challenges he set, I was able to brush up on some rusty theory topics, fine-tune some practical skills and learn some new skills and theory, giving me the confidence to take the examination at the end of the week.  It was a fun week.

SY Annecy (Jeanneau 37) was an ideal boat for this training week.  She is fully equipped and very well presented.  There was more than enough food and drinks 
for lunches and snacks each day.   Annecy also served as comfortable accommodation allowing me to study the boat and her equipment, revise theory topics and practice chartwork long after the training day was finished.

We were hugely impressed by the entire experience and would recommend rusailing to anyone with any interest at all in learning to sail (including at more advanced levels though we cannot speak directly to that). All of the five star reviews on this page are thoroughly merited.
- The organisation and advance communication by Jules were top notch and super clear, including not least giving helpful explanations and offering different options in light of the pandemic.
- The food options were delicious and carefully took into account dietary needs.
- The yacht was pristinely maintained and seemed ideal as a training yacht.
- We couldn't have been more impressed by the excellence of Rob's sailing knowledge and teaching (and are confident that he would only choose other instructors of similar quality). It genuinely felt like a privilege to have been able to spend two weeks learning with him. Everything was explained patiently and very clearly, and in multiple different ways, taking into account different learning styles, including demonstrating how it worked in practice to help it stick. No matter how many questions we asked he had detailed answers for everything, and delivered them in a way which built effectively on our growing knowledge base as the courses went on. We really can't say enough about what a brilliant learning experience it was.
- The Algarve is simply beautiful with good northerly winds coming in from the Atlantic (and on low wind days the teaching can be tailored so as to make good use of the time). Lagos Marina is a great home base. The sea swimming is very nice!
- Our tip: we paid a bit extra to have the yacht to the two of us mostly to be ""Covid safe"", but we thought it was thoroughly worthwhile and would recommend to anyone interested in a more intensive learning experience (plus the benefits of a bit more flexibility).
Rob and Jules are lovely people running a great small business and we were delighted to support them.

She delivered a safe and comfortable sailing experience at the full range of conditions we experienced. Over all we had great sailing conditions, with the heaviest weather up to perhaps 20+kts. Annecy was very well behaved and generated confidence to the crew in those conditions. Secondly, Rob is an excellent instructor. Patient, thoughtful and full of sailing knowhow and he also can communicate that information in a clear, understandable manner. I was not working on a specific course of instruction, but wanted to have Rob help me be better in areas where I have little experience. Rob and I discussed this prior to our week of sailing and Rob was great with helping me with what I wanted and additionally seeing where I had other gaps in experience and knowledge and helping to fill those gaps.

One in 2017 and one two weeks ago (July 2020).
In 2017 me and a group of friends from my Hostel did a lovely tour with Pedro and I was so stoked that I convinced my boyfriend, we booked the tour again and I didn't regret it one second. 

This year we met André in Sagres to climb the ""kindergarden wall"" for climbing beginners. We had the ability to enjoy the view while he prepared everything for us to go down the wall to land on a platform. From there we went up different paths that suited our abilities. We had a lot of fun and had cool challenges with beautiful views from the cliffs over the ocean. 
After the last climb up André collected all ropes and we were allowed to chill and rest :) We had a good conversation and got some insider tipps for restaurants and spots to go. This tour animated me to go climbing at home too and I can't wait to start. 

Your money is very well spent when you book a tour with Volta do Mar! They have different tours depending on how advanced you are, even if you've never been climbing before they can give you a good insight and help you to start.

Pedro as well as André are such sincere Persons and they put so much heart in their tours and their hobbies that you have no other choice than like them as they are :)

As the situation expanded I further contacted André voicing my concerns.  I found the advice reassuring and agreed to monitor the progress.  With sadness we had to cancel our holiday earlier this week and once again I contacted André.  With a speedy response  my FULL refund has been organised. 
One of the best points of this experience with Volta do Mar,  every step of the way   via prompt emailing customer consideration has been paramount, expressing relief that we are at least well!

I wanted to climb the cliffs of Sagres because they looked so beautiful, and was worried I wasn't a strong enough climber.  But after some emails back & forth, the team at Volta do Mar assured me that knew of the perfect area to match my experience. 

Pedro was a wonderful guide, very personable and enthusiastic. As he set things up at the top of the cliff, he explained all the knots and safety systems he was using. The rappel that I had been a little nervous about was actually a blast and not scary at all. Pedro had planned 4 routes for me to climb, they were fun and just challenging enough to make me feel accomplished. The rock is limestone, so be prepared for some sharp edges. After the first 2, he got out some home-made cookies (so yummy!) and fresh orange juice for me to enjoy while he moved the ropes over. For the last route, he belayed me from the top. It was a perfect afternoon of climbing, with the gorgeous views and the peaceful sounds of the waves below.

The entire experience with Volta do Mar was top-notch. They were very responsive to my emails when I was planning my trip, and Pedro picked me up from my lodging in Salema which was very convenient.

During our stay, we were able to communicate with Rodolfo via Whatsapp, I thought this was a great idea, as it felt like having a personal chauffer services on call.  Rodolfo was never longer than 30mins to come and pick us up during peak times and when he was busy he sent one of his team in an equally similar standard vehicle.  Otherwise he was there in 5 mins. But he always communicated well.
Another good little trick Rodolfo used was the Whatsapp locator to locate exactly where we were for pick up, when we had been at the beach or at a shopping centre.

Prices for the airport transfer were very reasonable, at 35 Euro each way and also to and from the beach and marina from our hotel for 6 Euro each way.  Although there were companies out there that may have been slightly cheaper, Rodolfo was always reliable and very efficient and always responded almost immediately.

A great service and would definitely recommend and use again when visiting Faro next.","Great, Efficient & Honest Service at Great Prices.",2021-08,,en,false,2021-08-31T00:23:03-04:00,5,"I can’t thank Rudi & his team enough for his hospitality whilst we’ve been on holiday in Portugal.

My mom recently died and I needed a mind reset. To do something for myself. I wanted to jump for years now... and I'm so glad I did! I called them via WhatsApp, asked all my questions and it was so helpful! I'm glad I chose the 15,000 feet, wanted to jump in the morning and added all the extra camera's and external handy cam. You really need all that for your first jump, document it, because it is definitely worth it.

The ride down was crazy fast, I could not believe the power of falling and basically forgot everything else I was a bit static up there while going down, but it was amazing. I asked for some salto's and was not disappointed. When the parachute opened, it was even more amazing! We did 360 degree sideways circles and I loved it!

I want to thank the whole team. Sara, thank you for being my key keeper and for all the help and information. Andy for the great external videocam work! I saw you did hold my hand on the video, but I was so surprised by the power of falling... I never noticed in the sky. Furthermore, I want to especially thank João for the awesome fun ride and experience! I'll never forget it! Thank you for letting me tag along. p.s. the restaurant recommendation was superb!

I have been to the Sagres area several times already but this time was the first time with Guiding through Niels. I know the area a little bit but there are just so many elements to take into consideration (swell, direction, wind, tide, crowds) to find a good place to surf. On past trips I have had good sessions but also a very high share of mornings driving around, checking everywhere and then going back to the first spot (at this time then usually more crowded and not as good anymore).  
Traveling with my family I need to be more “efficient”. With Niels you get to the best spot on that day - and have an amazing and super fun time.

There was plenty of space on the boat which was presented immaculately, we were greeted at the pontoon gate by the Skipper and led to the beautiful white Sunseeker Portofino.
After a glass of champagne we were off on our way destined for Portimão which is where we went previously on Yolo2, we decided to go back to the same place as we had such a fantastic time before.  The weather was amazing and pretty soon the music and generous offering of drinks began to relax us to a whole new level.  On route we were shown inside a few of the stunning caves that exist on the rocky coastline. We were given lots of interesting information from the crew about  the area, but it wasn’t forced upon us as happens on some tours.  It was more like talking to friends about a mutual love of a coastline .  We had lunch in Portimão and headed back to Yolo to continue the fun.
We saw some dolphins on the return journey along with the simply incredible Benagil cave, you can’t mistake this cave as it has a giant hole in the top, but Skipper James got us right inside, amazing.

Tony arrived at our hotel “on the dot” at the time agreed and we enjoyed the two halves of the Trip very much; firstly, overland to two local beaches where the sand and rock formations were stunning, and then into Albufiera itself. The vehicle allowed for access to narrow alleyways which you would not dream of trying to enter with a hire car or in a minibus! Tony’s very informative commentary throughout was also very informative and interesting. (The only part of the Schedule we did not undertake was a visit to the “Strip”. Tony said he would be happy to take us IF we wished but warned us it had become a very unpleasant place “in the last three or four years” full of brainless yobs who only had two aims; to drink themselves senseless and then pick a fight with each other - or anyone else! We thanked him for the advice, said we had (more than) had to our fill of such places elsewhere (Aida Nappa/Cyprus and Malia/Crete) and we enjoyed the “extra” time spent visiting a restored old windmill my ch more than I am sure we would have done seeing a bunch of drunken losers sprawled in the gutter, thank you!) (To add to the problem, England were playing a crucial World Cup match at the time of our Trip, so we are sure Tony’s advice was right.) Dropped back at our hotel “on the dot” after two hours despite this curtailment of the advertised Schedule - the final proof of Tony’s excellent, fully professional and trustworthy service.

Faro is quite a small town,  and by the afternoon of Day 1 we were looking for something to do on Day 2 rather than spend it in bars and restaurants!  Saw a leaflet for Portugal Safaris in the Tourist Information centre, checked out the reviews online and then gave Alberto a call to see if he was free. He sent over more info via WhatsApp and then after a bit of back and forth re. our choice of vehicle, collection time etc, he picked us up in his open top UMM (the one in the pic) at our hotel the next morning.

As other reviewers have said, for the countryside safari you get a full day visiting olive oil plants, hand made tile works, a windmill, a waterfall (where we also met a lovely friendly Rottie), baby turtles and many fruits, herbs and nuts to identify and try along the way.  We also stopped by a piggery where the adult pigs are semi-wild and we could see the baby piglets, and by chance the owner's daughter also had a cute little puppy for us to see too.

Oh and of course I mustn't forget the lunch picnic!  Absolutely lovely wholesome food, all prepared by Alberto - some hot and some cold, and even homemade jam!  He had brought enough to feed the five thousand, even though there were only three of us including himself :)  Alberto was a brilliant host and is clearly very passionate about what he does.

If you’re looking for a tour where the guide is genuine, kind and actually loves what they are doing this is the agency for you. We were only in Faro for three days and we managed to see all the scenery and i mean ALL with Alberto’s help. He showed us places even a person living in Faro has probably never seen. We took some really fun routes and saw the ocean from an amazing view in Albufeira and we got to explore the caves! 

We also got to sit down and eat a delicious picnic with a beautiful view of the ocean. 

Alberto took everything into consideration with allergies and food preferences and for some one who is a picky eater I was truly happy. It was all home cooked and the jam he made was great too. I couldn’t stop eating it. It made our trip and we are grateful we found him online, he knew details about everything, down to the rocks. We took the coast route and it was phenomenal and with Albertos expertise it made it even better. 

We travelled in December, so please don’t be put off from booking with him in the Winter. It was still worth it! 

I hope to return to Faro and have another tour with Alberto! Maybe to the countryside next time.

We have a house in Portugal so have been travelling here for last 10 years whilst our 3 kids have been growing up. They have always been to young to go on a full day out on a Jeep safari until now. They are 4,7 & 9 years so we thought it’s high time we ventured out (not saying we don’t go out but a full day out with 3 fully charged boys in a car is a challenge on its own, it’s hard enough getting to the beach or water park) we searched the web several weeks prior to arrival and we found “Portugal Safaris” by chance. We messaged Alberto and he was quick to respond day and night. Naturally one wonders how these days will start and if anyone will actually turn up but good thing is that Alberto never once pressured for money or anything like that, we set a date a time and he arrived bang on time. My wife and I went on a Portuguese Jeep safari many years ago so it was great to do it again but had high expectations. Needless to say that Alberto did not disappoint, the whole day was amazing. He’s knowledge of plants, fruits and wildlife is brilliant. The places we visited were superb, we stopped at a really nice place in S B Aportel for a picnic. We were expecting some dodgy sandwiches or stuff like that but we were well and truly gobsmacked with the spread Alberto laid out. Our kids (as most maybe) are quite fussy eaters, the tuna, chicken, salad and pasta were all divine. We all had a great laugh and left with our belly’s full.

We are now a week back in NYC (two weeks since our amazing tour) and we cannot get this snorkeling/hiking/hidden caves experience out of our minds! We met the van in the square in Ferragudo-only steps from our Air BnB-and picked up the rest of the party (limited to 8 which made a perfectly intimate tour!) We were then quickly outfitted with wet suits and water shoes, and headed to the beach.  After leaving our personal belongings and grabbing fins and goggles, we were OFF!

After short, easy (stunning) hike over the cliffs, and then down to a hidden beach, we suited up and were on our way! I chose this tour because I wanted to face my fear of snorkeling and being vulnerable to sea life...Also to discover some more ""untouched"" parts of the Algarve coast in a purer way. I have to say: these goals were satisfied on ALL FRONTS.

This company absolutely LOVES what they do; and that love is infectious. We always felt safe. At one point, we were given the option to take a dive under some rock into the hidden alcove--or simply follow our other guide around the other way around. It was nice to be as risky or timid as you wanted to be (but I would definitely recommend the risky route!!)   :)

Hours exploring the ocean through a snorkel with buoyant wet suits and fins left me feeling serene and ""one with the ocean"". We were both encouraged along the swim path and also allowed to explore areas we found interesting. Our lead guide pulled up a sea cucumber at one point, and let us touch it, which delighted the two little boys in our group! We saw a stingray burying itself in sand; cuddlefish, sardines in droves; and tons of other sea life..!

A day later, we had a ton of GoPro photos in our email--What a fully delivered tourist experience! We feel very lucky to have found Zip & Trip, and you will be glad you chose them too!

Pedro and Kenneth led our trip, and they were very knowledgeable about the sea and the flora and fauna. Remember to ask about the starfish fossil in the roof of the cave!
1st, we snorkeled over to the Cacém then into the cave. As it was low tide, we were able to go up on the beach inside the cave for a while, where we were shown the features of the cave band how it was formed. Really cool. The, we snorkeled out, and around a big haystack rock, over to some old sunken ships cannons, then into the beach. We saw lots of fish even though the water was a bit murky from the low tide.

We were a small group of just six which made it a really personal experience and gave us the opportunity to really explore without spending lots of time waiting for others to catch up or dealing with different levels of ability which is often the case with bigger groups.
There was also a real commitment by the team to make sure everyone got the most out of the tour and they were really helpful beforehand, answering our emails - they take out a small inflatable 'dinghy' which can hold a couple of small bags which was really useful for us with a Type 1 Diabetic in the family.
It's a full three hours - two hours actually in the water - and if the sea is choppy as it was for us then it's tiring but our boys managed it easily and loved the detour into the hidden cave.

As well as getting to see this brilliant animals we were also informed of there biological facts and history, and the kids enjoyed it because of Nemo:). 

We swam around a protected bird reserve and got to see some nesting birds, then to finish of the tour we were able to see 3 old sunken cannons, followed by a nice picnic.

 They take photos through out the trip as well as underwater photos where I got some great shots of not only the wildlife but also me snorkeling underwater with ginger hair, I still refuse to admit I'm ginger.

Both of them genuinely cared for us and our wishes. One could feel that they were dedicated to getting us in touch with their home and the environment. The tour really is not just another commercial snorkeling tour, but one which tries to discover the less crowded places at the Algarve in small groups, always in both eco-friendly and humorous manner.

the hike - moderately challenging...the perfect level to make it feel like you were exerting yourself, but not to the point of 'too much'; and you are out there without the tourist buses!

The day lasts from 1pm to about 10pm, but you are not hiking all that time. The actual hiking distance is only about 3-4 miles. 
There's a bit of a drive (30mins - ish) out to the west coast at first, then the getting to know each other bits, and then there are plenty of stops during the hike to look at the views or where TJ will tell you great facts about the area/flora/rocks/history and then the picnic on the beach at the end. If you have an basic level of fitness and dont mind climbing over a few rocks you'll be fine.
At the end you have a little picnic on the beach and do some star gazing, TJ knows his stuff... get ready for the laser!

It gets windy, very windy - take more layers than you think you will need, as you'll be chilly, esp after sunset, but dont worry if you forget, TJ has plenty of back ups and will make sure you take enough with you. Also note as you are in the wilderness - the bushes are your loos! 

My favourite things were:
- not seeing another soul the whole day - you're out in the wilderness
- the varying scenery....rocks, cliff faces, beach, sea
- TJs facts about the area - seeing rosemary and sage growing in the wild
- the food in the tapas picnic as the end - your plate(s) are slices of bread, then you top with olive tapenade, sweet tomatoes, marinated carrots, white bean hummus - it was so so tasty

So I was rather skeptical about going on a guided group hike. But it turned out to be one of the most remarkable outdoor travel experiences I’ve had in recent years. After he picked us up in the touristy resort town of Lagos, it took our guide TJ just a half hour or so of driving to bring us to southern Portugal’s windswept, wild west coast. Just about the only other people we saw were beachgoers below us in the far distance, who probably had no idea about the natural beauty around them, waiting to be explored. 

If you’re in southern Portugal just for a few days, like I was, it’s hard to imagine that you’ll find this natural beauty by yourself. The hiking along the unsigned trails wasn’t particularly hard or long (there were people of a wide range of ages and fitness levels on our tour) but it all felt much more remote than I’d thought possible in such a popular tourist region. 

TJ, an American who has lived in this part of Portugal for a number of years, was an incredible guide. He was brilliant at bringing the group of about 8 people together and making sure that we paused to smell, hear, feel, and even taste the nature around us. And the way he ended the evening — sunset, picnic, wine, stargazing — was wonderful and creative.

Ksenia was incredibly sweet. I texted some hours before arriving because I was anxious not to miss the opportunity to rent quality boards from them. Ksenia kept aside a mounting rack for our car (provided when you rent boards) in anticipation of our arrival, which was a blessing as it was the last one. She also provided some quality nuggets of information about the local area and beaches . This made a big difference.

Rick was also kind and incredibly helpful in taking the time to demonstrate how to use their mounting racks effectively, which we both valued and appreciated!

Thank you both for your professional and friendly service. It made a significant impact on us and was a highlight for us during our two-week tour. Hope to see you again during the winter!

Also, the prices are very affordable. You can rent for a whole day and you get discounts from 4 days. 

Lagos is a good place to surf when on the west coast it is too big. That was in my case. From this centre it is possible to walk with the board towards meia praia and porto mós. If you have a car you can also rent boards and go to other beaches. There are many options nearby.

It's a bit of a tale...

We borrowed two stand up paddleboards for four hours (I think it was 25 euros ish) to explore the beautiful coastline from Lagos. We arrived without a booking and managed to get a couple. The lovely woman who runs the place checked the usual safety things plus showed us a live webcam of the surf conditions and a map of coves to check out. One thing to look out for: it was cash only! You also need ID and something valuable (said ID) to leave behind. We'd actually only got a photo of our ID and a bank card to leave and they were kind enough to make an exception. They threw in life jackets and drybags for no extra cost.

Off we trotted on the 8 minute walk to the beach (a bit cumbersome with the boards so do factor that in). We had a lovely half hour exploring and I'd really recommend SUPs to check out the area at your own pace. HOWEVER...

Out of nowhere I got the most seasick I've ever been in my life. For the course of about 30 minutes, I was stuck in the ocean, lying on my board, vomiting my breakfast directly back into the sea. Grim. We eventually managed to paddle our way to a cove but even on dry land, I was totally gone. No idea what hit me but hey ho...

We called the shop to explain and they immediately hopped in the car and came to the random beach we were at. They helped us dry off the boards, deflate them and get them in the car. After dropping those back at the shop, they then came back to give us a lift to the shop and make sure us pathetic landlubbers were safe.

So kind and thoughtful and without a snarky word or disgusted glance despite our ridiculous condition...

They took a lot of time to explain us the different beaches in the region, how to decide independently which beach to choose depending on the different weather conditions and also offered us to help if we have further questions during our rental time (9 days, 2 boards and a 4/3mm wetsuit). 
They also allowed us to exchange boards from their wide variety of boards as often as we wanted - which we did. If necessary they also borrow for free rooftop racks to transport the surfboards safely.  

Finally, something we would like to highlight:
Unluckily, during the rental time one of the boards broke during our Surf. Despite this loss they were very supportive, stayed longer than their opening hours to give us a new board so that we can directly continue to surf the next morning and supported us with the necessary documents for the insurance. 

Overall the interaction was uncomplicated, super friendly and helpful.

I love that the room works equally well in multiple languages.

I don't like horror movies and get scared easily, but I LOVED this escape room--I was so engaged that I never wanted to tap out. Our 13-year-old son also had a fabulous time, and the older teen boys and my husband loved it as well.

It's excellent value for money, informative and on a boat second to none. The crew are fantastic and booking easy.
Pedro and Ricardo are a font of historical knowledge and also on the ecology of the river system and the wildlife upon it. The boat is small enough to feel like a personal trip but large enough that your comfort is not compromised in any way.

Snacks and drinks are provided on the journey and I can highly recommend the lovely wine we sampled.
This is not just a simple river tour but is a history lesson,a beautiful relaxing journey and and a chance to discover the water ways and those that live on them or alongside. 

Close your eyes and you hear nothing but birdsong, the waves gently lapping the boat or fishes splashing softly on the surface. Being powered by solar energy there is no chug , chug ,chug to spoil the atmosphere. 

We all felt this trip was undervalued for the experience we received in return, having left the boat feeling like we had journeyed with friends having shared many laughs along the way.

Silves is a beautiful place to visit but the boat ride especially made it more memorable as did the return journey where we sampled more of the coastline before sailing home into the sunset.

We wish Pedro, Ricardo and Ana continued success in this venture and will 100% do this journey again whenever we revisit Portugal in the future.",Highly recommended.Excellent trip.,2018-09,,en,false,2018-08-25T15:47:07-04:00,5,"We booked this boat trip 1 day in advance on our holiday in Ferragudo (a village a few kilometers from Portimão). When we arrived we were waiting near the boat at the harbor instead of the meeting point at the kiosk (because we couldn't find it). We called the company to say we were already standing near the boat. This was no problem for them and we started to continue the boat trip. When we met the guide and the family who were also joining us we were warmly welcomed by them! Normally the tour takes about approximately 75 min, but the tourguide told us if it was a big problem for us if the tour would take a little longer then expected, this was undoubtely no problem for us because we were on a holiday. The family who also joined us were portugese. This was no problem for us because the tourguide would also take the time to explain everything in English. The tourguide learned us a lot about the history of the city during the trip and even would take the time to learn us a little about how to drive the boat! We even got the chance to drive the boat by ourself! This was a great experience for us and also for the kids who were on the boat with us. Furthermore we all got the chance to relax with a lovely local rosé wine that was given by our tourguide. The tour eventually took about 2+ hours. I strongly recommend this trip for tourists (or families) with or without kids. It was great to see the passion this tourguide had! When we are back in this city we would definitely do this tour again! 10/10!",Great experience!,2018-08,,en,false,2018-08-19T09:19:13-04:00,5,"At first we wanted to thank Pedro for the great tour, he took 3 hours to guide us through the Arade river and even showed us some beaches. 

Surely would recommend this trip, great experience, we had a nice swim and Pedro is very friendly, relaxed and helpful.

Thanks again for the nice trip Pedro, hope to see you soon in Rotterdam !",Great trip,2018-08,,en,false,2018-07-18T10:39:35-04:00,5,"Excellent boat trip. 

Pedro is a really joyfull man who guides you with his local expertise through the magnificent landscapes. We wanted a trip with some rest, the boat is small so you won't have a crowded feeling like on the other touristic boats with big groups. 

The groups are so small that it even feels a bit like a private tour. The boat doesn't make any noise. Ideal trip to become zen, to enjoy mother nature and to see Portimão and its surroundings from another point of view. 

The only advice I can give: do not hesitate and take this trip. You won't regret any second.

Pedro, I am really thankfully for this wonderful experience. Thanks for letting me sailing. This trip made me really happy.
Obrigado!

I cannot recommend this company enough.
What a great day.",Awesome experience,2022-09,,en,false,2022-08-22T01:41:34-04:00,5,"Before leaving the UK I spent time planning a few activities for our trip to Quinta do Lago. We are a family of three and all wanted to try either buggy riding or quad biking. I got in touch with a number of providers and just felt from the initial response from Rute that this was the one - professional, personal and quick to respond with information and advice bespoke to us.

When we arrived in Quinta I got in touch again with Rute and she guided us through the process. This is a family business with passion for their business and most importantly their customers.

The instructor Rui collected us from the meeting point and made us feel relaxed as soon as we met. The equipment they use is second to none - too many try and cut corners in this area - not Rui and Rute, you and your family will be 100% safe with these guys.

 Rui is clearly a natural coach and host - we all felt confident to ride the quads as soon as we set off (after Rui spent time with us to teach us how to deal with the Quads properly in each 'challenge' we would come up against). 

He has a 'practice area' on his land which you send time on to get used to the quads, and then we headed 'off road' up into the hills - the climb and descent were so so much fun! On the summit of the climb Rui stopped us, gave us water (it was a hot afternoon!) and then took time explain what we could see in our 360 degree view (including Spain) and provided some suggestions of where to go to experience 'real Portugal'.

This was without doubt one of the best holiday experiences we have ever been on - yes, this is a business, but it never felt 'commercial' - we went as a family of three and the experience was based on us, not some pre planned route with a large group.

One final thing - I would definitely recommend paying the extra 10 euro's to have Rui take photo's - you are too busy having fun to worry about this yourself, and it would be difficult to do so anyway until you are not moving. Rui takes a lot of photo's and all of ours are great quality - group shots, individual shots and actin shots.

Thank you Rute and Rui - I hope your business continues for many years to come, so more people will be lucky enough to experience what you have to offer.

This was just the first of at least three caves you will visit in this tour! We also had the pleasure of being guided by John who also doubles as a photographer during the whole trip. I can tell you that I have done tours in many parts of the world and John is simply one of the best guides there are.

The are just some many things to love about the experience we had that I could go on forever. I will just finish by saying that the time, location and guide where just a miracle to come all together for us, the good news is that it can come together for you too when you book a tour with them.

Carlitos: He is an incredible captain. He knows those waters and caves inside and out. Just when you think you’ve seen it all, he will turn the boat around and surprise you! He’s genuinely a good guy. He makes the experience so so fun! 

The crew: Carl had team members sitting with groups according to language, to make sure we each got a personalized experience that we could understand. This was incredibly thoughtful. Not only that, but the crewmembers were really great people who shared stories and brought the experience to life. 

The views: I thought we were going to see one cave, but surprise after surprise we saw caves, villages & lighthouses, and learned a lot about the area. I won’t spoil the fun for you, just know you will be delighted. 

Weather: We went at the beginning of March, so the weather wasn’t the greatest. No other company was taking boats out that day. Carl and his crew watched the weather, and as the ocean calmed down and the sky brightened up, he was able to take out our small group. I am incredibly grateful for the experience. 

Value: We booked this on get your guide, you can do that or go direct. I will say, we got way more out of the experience than we paid for. This is how they make their living in an economy that depends on tourism. We tipped them generously at the end. 

This showed me views I never would have seen from land. I cannot wait to go back to the Algarve region when the weather is calmer and paddleboard through these caves. 

I’d book with Carl again in a heartbeat. This adventure was absolutely the highlight of our week in Portugal. 

I can post a few photos, but I will tell you that they do not do justice to the actual experience we had on the boat.

We were very excited and showed up more than an hour before the time we had to meet up. We walked over to a cafe (there were 4 on that road) and had a coffee. They had wifi so when the tour guide was able to call us to confirm and we told them we came very early and just having a coffee. We walked back to the tour guide van and there was 5 guys there from the tour playing soccer and not paying attention to any customers. We checked in with one of them and he told us since we are early we should walk to the end of the road and relax and have a coffee and we will be launching from there. Since this is the first time we have been to the area, we walked to the end, which was the marina. There was another tour guide there and we asked her if this is the meeting spot and she said yes. When we started to get into the boat, they realized we were with the wrong tour. We ran back to the van and the boat had left us. No one told us where to go or where to wait or any signs indicating the waiting spot.
No one bothered to walk the 10 meters to check if we were waiting on the bench at the marina for over an hour.
They told us the next boat was at noon but we had to drive to the airport. And they tell us, this is not the first time this has happened...like this should make us feel better! We told them, if this is not the first time it has happened then why not give better directions! or tell us to wait with you and we all walk to the boat launch. They really didn't care.

We enjoyed the time and learned how to start, stand up on the board and surf the waves in a beautiful spot with the right conditions for us.  Marcos our instructor was accurate and clear with the theory and followed us in the water to support and correct our mistakes. He's also very funny !
The school is well organised, they pick up the participants at their accommodation on time every morning.  We managed easily the booking on Internet, followed on WhatsApp for details and updates.

I never got his name but he was older and had been providing surf instruction for 20+ years at this company, and was our instructor that day. Logistically, everything was ok - we were picked up at our hotel in Lagos in a large van, drove to the beach, got wetsuits, boards etc. They were no places to change in & out of clothes or use a washroom but this wasn't a big deal for us.

What was a big deal was the atmosphere our instructor created. The instructor was confusing, did not provide much initial direction, and for the entire duration, he did not say one positive thing. He complained and yelled at everyone. This included getting mad at people for how they walked with the board, how they dismounted after catching a wave, how they changed out of their wetsuit, how they carried their belongings, and even got mad if people cheered after their friend caught a wave. He was very mean and provided no positive reinforcement for those just starting out - just yelling and negative criticism. I remember a few surfers caught waves for their first time, and instead of congratulating them he would just yell at them to do something different. It seemed like he honestly didn't care at all and just wanted our money to pump us through the production line. It got to the point where some people just stopped surfing, out of fear they would get yelled at no matter what they did. 

My partner and I were shocked at how bad the environment was and we were both very upset which ruined the experience - we understand there are safety components that need to be rigorously followed, however the experience should still be very fun and rewarding. I have no idea how this guy still works at the company but maybe no one ever provides him feedback or he has a power complex where he just doesn't care. He needs to be taught that HE is working for US; WE are not working for HIM. He should treat clients accordingly. 

The day would have been A LOT better with another instructor. There was another lady who seemed more positive and created a welcoming, fun environment, however I didn't directly interact with her. I'm sure the majority of 5 star reviews are people with these other instructors, so overall this experience may be worth doing, but I would try to make sure you don't get the guy we had. He will likely see this review and not reflect on it at all (unless this is the first time he's had feedback in over 20 years). All of our other experiences near Lagos were awesome!

The wetsuits that Nelson provided were clutch and made the experience that much more comfortable. I imagine we would have all three been freezing if it weren’t for that helpful component. Nelson gave us a head’s up that the swells were too high and that it was safer to go earlier in the morning (a sunrise SUP tour) at a different location, which ended up being an insanely cool experience.

Due to the time of the year, we were the only guests so we had a 'private tour', which was fun. My girlfriend actually is scared of heights and open water, so I must have been a bit crazy to try this experience. Nelson really took his time and went very easy on her. She even jumped a few times and dared to climb the high rocks, which is admirable. 

The thing I enjoyed most, is feeling very liberated in the open water, with waves passing by and feeling the real power of the ocean without feeling scared. We also have seen some beautiful caves, which was cool!

The only feeling I had is that we had not so much time to really enjoy the scenery and the experience itself, but I think the reason must have been my girlfriend, who took a lot of time to dare the jumps, swims etc.

We had a great experience and I would recommend this to the more daring people out there.

Very caring of the community and that you get to have a ""local's"" feel for all of it, the people and the things to do, the street art and more. His recommendations for everything except food were spot on an very helpful. 

For food, he is Portuguese and their tastes are sometime quite different from what many prefer. They like (IMHO) too much salt and not enough other herbs and spices though there is almost always enough garlic and EVOO. But of 4 restaurants he thought highly of we tried only the Ice Cream and Pasteria were places we have gone back too. The two restaurants were at best only enh. 

But we've been to sights and used other tours he thought well of and like his tour we found them to be great. His tour was so good we may do it a second time (to fill in what was missed and friends can get the same perspective we have).

Roberto then brought us to the wine and food tasting. Carla showed us the beautiful space and introduced herself.

In actual fact the tour is so much more than that which added to the experience. 

We met at the Real Marina hotel where there is parking available. Roberto was the guide for us and he was excellent, very knowledgable and enthusiastic about the tour and his city and it’s area. He went into depth on the history, took us to the salt flats telling us all about them and also gave us the low down on the tiles on the building and the door knockers which all have different meanings. 

He also showed us the library, prison and the football stadium and some back streets that you would never normally stumble upon. It was an excellent city tour which we absolutely loved. 

We then went to Carla’s traditional Portuguese house for some wine & port tasting as well as the food; WOW! doesn’t quite cover it! 

There was a whole table loaded with fresh, home cooked food which all looked and tasted fantastic. Carla went into detail about the food and how she prepared it all. She was keen to let us know that with advanced notice she can cater for vegetarians and vegans too creating some fantastic dishes. 

We then went onto the actual wine and port tastings which were advertised as about 3 wines and 1 port, in actual fact we tasted more wines than I can remember and a lot more than just 1 port. The measures we got were about half a glass as well not just your usual ‘tasting’ absolutely excellent and really good value for money so far! All the wines and port was available to buy and take away with you but there was no hard sell, it was just a case of ‘this is this one and a bottle is.....’ 

There was also loads of information from Carla about how the grapes are grown and how it’s all produced, there was also a lovely white port to try. 

Based on this experience if you’re based in the area and don’t do this tour I’d say your mad. As I said it’s advertised as a wine tasting but it’s so much more than that!

At €60 for 2 people it was value personified (we paid an extra €20 for pick up/drop off, which was a 15 minute drive).

They spent 45 minutes giving us a tour of the City, including the salt flats, historical buildings, and points of interest around the City. 
After the lovely tour, we were taken to Carla’s magical wine cellar where we were greeted by a lavish banquet of Portuguese tapas, all of which were made and presented with love and panache.  Each and every dish was superb, in terms of taste, quantity and in presentation.  All the ingredients were the finest, and all locally sourced from local markets or farmers.  Truly delicious. 
We were presented with an abundance of wonderful Portuguese wines - each one lovingly chosen to present their characteristics, and the massive differences between wines of the same type - eg Vinho Verde.
The explanations were clear, informative, and precise.  They wines were clearly known, and were eloquently described.  Carla’s manner was so friendly and knowledgable, it was a treat to listen!
After many different wines, Ports and Grappas, the afternoon, sadly came to an end.  There was no push to buy wines, but they were there if wanted. 
I have been on dozens of wine tours in my time - not least because I was a tutor in an hotel school - but this was certainly the friendliest and most enjoyable one that I’ve ever been on; my three friends concur.

Following leaving a separate review on the dolphin & caves tour I feel like I should leave one on these two tours.

We ended up having the same driver for both of these trips, George, and he was brilliant. Shared loads of amazing facts about Portugal, the Algarve and especially.. cork! 

The 4x4 trip was brilliant, was exactly as it said on the tin. The views from Monchique mountain were amazing and the lunch on the trip was tasty. The only downside to this trip was that we were in the back for the majority of it so the window view wasn’t fantastic and you do get tossed around a bit but since we were the last ones to get picked up, we didn’t have much of a choice but we loved it all the same. The firewater was interesting but the honey was a treat, we bought a jar of it home. 

The sunset & moonlight tour was different, even though we ended up on Monchique again, the whole atmosphere was different. It was a beautiful sunset that evening and made it even more special with the amazing photos George took of myself and my partner.. and made a great camera man when my partner surprised me by proposing. Again another delicious meal once we were descending mountain.

Incredibly clean-I was asked to sanitise on my way in and was given sanitised flip flops for the time I was there. 

I’d emailed the spa to book prior and asked for a full body oil massage-focusing on my feet, hands and head-which is exactly what I got. Real mixture of technique at, warm oil and towels. Just bliss!

Neil has so much experience and I only had to hit a few balls before he had lazered into the key issue in my swing - lack of rhythm. He was able to back up his eye by showing me the data about my club and ball speed. He was honest that I would need to up my practice to train my swing before i could expect consistency on the course. But he gave me great confidence that I am on the right track and by focusing on rhythm and not going 120% every shot I would get consistency.

After a quick introduction into the local way of fishing, what’s unique and special about it and which steps to observe, we headed off into the night in a small boat, packing just the four of us and a lot of fishing gear to choose from. Once the sun had sunk and the boat was parked at our buoy, we turned on the fishing lights. With the illuminated ocean around us, the night turned magic. Dropping our hand lines in, we went for squid, which we pulled on board in kilos, along with a large cuttlefish. Splattered with blue ink, we then went for mackerel with proper fishing rods, trying different techniques. We caught enough to provide us for probably two nights of abundant family meals (each!) so we decided to stop, watch and listen to the dolphin mom and kid coming very close to the boat. An absolutely priceless experience, thoroughly thought-out and properly planned by very cool people.
