Despite the lack of agreement among historians concerning the date its construction began, the fortress is dated to the year 1582, when King Philip II visited Setubal. The Castle of St. Philip, more frequently referred to as a fort or fortress, played a tactical role in strengthening the line of defence of the Portuguese coast that was attacked by pirates from northern Europe and Africa.

The beauty of the place is captivating, almost out of a movie - recommend 110% if in the area of Setubal. 

You won’t be able to take you car directly to the beach and the directions provided by google maps is wrong. Instead of driving along the coast (coming from Setubal), go direction Sierra da Arrabida.

Make sure to stop along the way in any of the view points at the Sierra, the views are incredible.

Once you get to the entrance to Portinho there will be a guard, park wherever you can and walk down (about 10mins) or for €2-€3 you can ride down on tuk tuk’s that operate for most of the day. 

Once you get to Portinho, you can enjoy a meal at any of the restaurants or just chill at the beach. I believe there a boat rides that operate from there but we never booked any.

Instead, I found myself in an impressive array of painting and sculpture. I had been thinking that, in the USA, we rarely hear about the great Portuguese masters of visual art--here's a collection that proves that these people were comparable with the masters.

The first floor contains a reception desk where you'll find people who are clearly passionate about their mission. A large part of the floor is devoted to religious art from a local convent/monastery that's long been decomissioned but now the building is being renovated (a massive project, needed foundation work) and so the art is on loan here until the reno is complete.

So you will find icons and paintings from the late medieval through the renaissance, mostly of Portuguese provenance, and frankly, some of the works are stunning.

The remainder of the first floor is two rooms showing regional paintings from later historical times--some of them reflecting fauvism or formalism or other modernist styles--and a sculpture room, also with more recent works, many of them contemporary.

The upstairs is devoted to special exhibits. On this occasion, they had a solo showing of sculptor Virgilio Domingues, and it was world-class in quality.

I have chosen carefully and all have provided me with excellent cultural and table tennis experiences.  TTPOR was no exception. In addition, the two coaches, David and Domingos were able to provide me with the individual attention my game needed. 

I stayed and trained at TTPOR for four weeks in February and March of this year and agree with other reviewers that it is a great place to improve your game. I can also confirm the positive Trip Advisor and Table Tennis Daily reviews of the club and Setubal are accurate and will omit much of the information found in these reviews.

I ate my meals in the dorm and had two daily training sessions in the morning and afternoon (2 hours each); mostly individual training with David.  I also had several individual sessions with Domingos and group sessions with others from the club. Most evenings I also practised with club players.

As described in other reviews the accommodation and food when staying at the club are basic and not for everyone. Still, I am glad that I chose this option as it allowed me to immerse myself in a table tennis club, and to better know the delightful Diniz family and the Portuguese people who frequented the club. It also allowed me to watch other clubs compete against the TTPOR team.

My level of play has certainly benefited from my time at TTPOR and I highly recommend TTPOR to table tennis players of all ages and levels of play.",TTPOR - Academia de Tenis de Mesa,2019-02,,en,false,2018-12-10T06:38:57-05:00,5,"I visited TTPOR for a week and had a great time. It's a great place for Table Tennis enthusiast who wants to improve their game.

You have several options here: training only, training/food, training/food/lodging. If you choose the latter, like I did, you'll stay in the club dorm - nothing fancy, but very adequate. I was the only one staying there at the time, so it worked very well for me, but it might be different if you have neighbors. Food is quite simple but good - you get to see what a typical Portuguese meal is, especially at lunch and dinner.  

I've had 2 daily training sessions in the morning and afternoon (each 1.5-2 hours), mostly 1-1 training with either Domingos (club owner) or his son David (he plays on the club's main team as well), or small group sessions with other club members. Both coaches are ITTF-certified, and David also has good experience with long pips, since he played at pretty high level with them. In the evening you have an option of practicing with club players, which means you can have 5-6 hours of TT per day.

David (my main coach during this visit) is quite good at identifying flaws in your game and designing drills and exercises to address them. He also paid close attention to the intensity of training, to  make sure you are challenged but not overwhelmed. 

TTPOR is located inside a football stadium, which is about 10 min walk from a city center with plenty of restaurants (there is a decent pizzeria right next to the club :) ) and is only ~5 min walk from a train station.

De tocht begon met een 10 min hike naar de ingang van de grot. Daar aangekomen werden wij door twee instructeurs begeleid door de grotten van Portugal. 

De nauwe ruimtes en het klimmen in een donkere grot zorgt voor gezonde spanning en veel avontuur. Bij sommige nauwe doorgangen is het even passen en meten waardoor je soms buiten je comfort zone moet stappen en door moet zetten. Uiteindelijk kom je uit op z'n 22 meter onder de grond, op het laagste punt. Na 3,5 uur (afhankelijk van de snelheid van je groep) stonden wij weer buiten, met een grote dosis adrenaline, spanning en ook voldoending dat iedereen het gehaald heeft. 

De instructeurs zijn vriendelijk en helpen iedereen om door de smalle gang te manoeuvreren. Daarnaast bieden ze ook een transfer aan vanuit Lisabon naar Arribida voor €25,- per persoon. 

Marco, bedankt voor alle goede zorgen en de spannende beleving in de grotten! Deze ervaring zullen wij niet snel vergeten.

Of course all the kids begging to  their parents  to buy it. The price was 3 EUR ( never saw it even in NY or Tokyo, or Miami beaches....). Of course it is another business for Vertigem Azul that abuses the time they have us onboarded to sell us products nothing to do with dolphins!

We followed most of his suggestions, but used the Hop on Hop Off for touring the area, which he didn't think much of but we found useful in off season. He picked us up at Valverde Hotel and took us on a full day transfer/tour to Porto, The Yeatman. We recommend both hotels. On the way we took four side trips on his recommendations and they were excellent choices in the off season (November). Paolo is a wealth of knowledge of the local history and very personable and informative. At his recommendation we enjoyed a seafood lunch at a restaurant in Nazaré that was memorable. He is well known in the area and when he takes you somewhere you are made to feel like a VIP.

We travelled with Alex many times across almost a week including:

Porto to Lisbon. A Lisbon city tour. Lisbon to Evora. And Evora to Seville Spain. 

To say the service was excellent would be understating how much we enjoyed the travel. This was a new way of seeing the country for us and was a most efficient way of moving from place to place. 

Alex was an extremely safe driver, gave excellent touring suggestions and was well versed in giving us some important history lessons along the way. The vehicles used were roomy and comfortable.

Uma vez que a família é grande e estamos radicados na Suiça há muito tempo, optamos por os serviços da 2FeelPortugal.
A forma como fomos tratados foi mais como se de família se tratasse do que um contrato comercial.... O Paulo foi de uma simpatia e sensibilidade sensacionais. Levou-nos a visitar Sintra, a Regaleira e Lisboa. Depois levou-nos a Óbidos e Fátima e, de seguida a Coimbra.
Depois Aveiro, Porto, Braga e Guimarães. Para além do profissionalismo, sempre nos mimou com pequenas surpresas dos locais visitados.
No Porto, Braga, Guimarães e Douro tivemos o acompanhamento da Júlia com quem também nos relacionamos de imediato dada a sua simpatia. Adorámos ouvir as histórias que contou sobre estes locais.....
