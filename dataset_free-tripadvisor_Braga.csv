We three middle aged Brits were staying in town three nights and this was on our list. One of us is against church or cathedral entrance fees so we split up. At around 3:30pm I bought the full €5 ticket whilst my friend bought just the Cathedral €2 ticket in the side street entrance to the cathedral complex. My ticket included a guided tour of the chapels and upper choir, scheduled at 4pm.

We both had a walk around the cathedral which is quite plain with the statues on stretchers for decorating and hauling around town during Santa Semana. The organ was the most impressive thing in the church though. My friend left and I waited for the tour.

A group of mainly Portuguese gathered and a guide took us through the complex to a series of very interesting chapels of various ages. Tiled walls, pigment decorated walls, tombs, a very wrinkly but undecomposed archbishop (it's a miracle apparently), florid walls, turkish influences, mum&dad statues above tombs, miracle fruits....

I was the only English speaker there so the guide patiently repeated everything personally to me in English whilst an apprentice listened in.

Up we went a few flights of stairs into the upper choir which was amazing! Two identical working organs were at the alter end of the rows of named seats of the choir. A 'clock' at the end was set at 3pm as that's when Christ was nailed to the cross.

Later we three rejoined and wandered round the free parts of the cathedral complex including the archbishop tombs and a chapel with lots of wax figures of heads, legs and arms....a local custom?

Altogether a very good value excursion, especially with the one to one commentary! 

The managers just really need to get rid of that rubbish euro paladin bin in the courtyard though…..","Great organ, good value combi ticket, plain interior but undressed statues ready for santa semana","2022-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/13/b9/83/a4/mike-k.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/b9/83/a4/mike-k.jpg","147","0","0","169","5079","501","0","818","2010-12-29T17:44:17-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.26D84FD64672E0892FC634B0659E56F2","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","26D84FD64672E0892FC634B0659E56F2","186338","London, United Kingdom","MikeLondonSE","en","false","2022-05-26T05:59:33-04:00","4","Impressive facade and portal but it does seem to have been hemmed in somewhat bylater additions.

There is a nominal charge to visit the church, and it will cost you a few more euros on top of that for the chapels, high choir, and museum. Go for it!

Its best documented history dates back to the work of the first bishop, D. Pedro de Braga, and corresponds to the restoration of the Episcopal and this in the year 1070, of which few traces are preserved.
In the year 1128, a building with five chapels at the apse was started, which were partially destroyed by the earthquake in the year 1135.
In the year 1268 the works were still not completed. On the outbuildings of the former house of the “Cabido”, built at the beginning of the 18th century by Archbishop D. Rodrigo de Moura Teles, currently stands the Braga Cathedral Treasure-Museum.
In the 20th century, the tomb of the religious and stigmatized Sister Maria Estrela Divina, a center of great popular devotion, was placed next to the cloisters. His collection of Sacred Relics became famous, including the piece of a Mantle of the Holy Virgin Mary, in the Chapel of Relics. There are chests containing the bones of many saints, and the so-called Holy Ark is legendary, whose contents will be remarkable, and went out in procession in the past, on days of solemn feasts.
It has been classified as a National Monument since the year 1910.","Visiting the city of Braga.","2021-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","1686","0","133","166","8759","222","0","2075","2011-09-25T09:37:40-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","1444586","Santa Comba Dao, Portugal","hans-jaguar","en","false","2021-10-18T11:26:38-04:00","5","As the proverb says, Porto works, Braga prays, Coimbra studies, and Lisbon gets the money.

The Cathedral is cavernous as you'd expect but still retains a homely and welcoming feel. I loved the banners hanging from the walls between the windows and the unbelievably intricate and decorative organ at the back of the nave. The altar is simple, but it has gorgeous stained glass windows flanking stand beautifully carved chorister chaurs.
Most if the visit will be spent at the gold gilted organ I suspect.

We have been there in September and the gardens behind the monastery have been filled with the scent of the ripe grapes. Please do not miss this place when in Portugal.

Although unoccupied since the late 1800s it has all been restored beautifully and there still is a feeling of calm and tranquility. The audio guide was very useful and guided us around all the features however there was also a leaflet in English which could have been used with a map. We were lucky when we visited as there were probably no more than 20 other people there and due to the vastness of the place it often felt like we had it to ourselves. We had heard the restaurant had closed down some time ago so were delighted to find the ladies belonging to a Holy Order had reopened it. The food was really lovely and the veal escalope had to be seen to be believed as it was enormous! All served by the ladies who did so with friendliness and good humour despite our limited Portuguese. This definitely was one of our highlights of the region.","A well kept secret with a lovely restaurant","2019-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","13","0","11","15","0","28","0","56","2008-07-29T13:38:07-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.9733640D44B5ECA97B01E1B9E2D87B05","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","9733640D44B5ECA97B01E1B9E2D87B05","186338","London, United Kingdom","ShenfieldFamily","en","false","2019-01-10T09:04:02-05:00","5","when i arrived at this monastery just before it opened at 10 i couldn't see 100 yards in front of me because of the mist,one hour later when it had lifted one gets to see this grand and imposing monastery in all it's glory and what a sight it is,you'll also find the inside is huge and with audio in portuguese and english on offer you'll not only get to see some of the marvels this monastery has to offer you'll also get to learn.

I went out of season by bus from the centre of Braga. Made a special effort as it was closed on Monday when I wanted to go. The bus stop is just round the corner from the Ibis hotel and is a somewhat limited timetable but managed to squeeze in a good visit between buses although it took the best part of a whole morning it was worth it. Got the first bus out and got there as they were opening or perhaps they had seen me walking up the long green area in front the bus stop. I had the place to myself and it was exquisite and surprisingly large. I did get good vibes from the old corridors, the courtyards, the cloisters, the church and the little rooms but best of all was the garden where it was just so easy to imagine the monks working outside planting and hoeing. I was entranced at how close it must have been to what it used to be and dawdled there transfixed imagining the monastic activity. There was an unfortunate fire that burnt down the dining area/rectory which must have been tragic however they have made it into a new modern area for students and visitors to attend lectures and hold events. There was a video looping in a room which was a bit educational (in portuguese) but I suspect was made more for the funders of the renovations. The kitchen is worth a look eventhough it was altered in 18thC? it still exuded an aura of times past. There is a hotel here it seemed nice but I didn't stay there. The audio guide was helpful and informative and free (refundable deposit). This a jewel of a building and  helped me transport myself to mediaval times especially the small garden areas but I imagined I could hear the cartwheels in the courtyard and see the monks moving ghostly, serenely and silently around this large and suprsingly enchanting building. Get there if you can you are not likely to regret it.","Enchanting ghostly jewel","2016-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/c7/2b/ee/chasingclouds.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/c7/2b/ee/chasingclouds.jpg","73","0","17","6","52","6","0","86","2011-06-02T14:33:43-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.1C62C44895C827169355189EA8D7CB87","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","1C62C44895C827169355189EA8D7CB87",,"London","Chasingclouds","en","false","2016-03-22T08:08:11-04:00","5","a whole day it's not enough to visit and see all the beauties of this ancient Monastery.

The exterior of the church is imposing. You will take quite a few pictures of it from different angles, because it looks good every which way you turn. Then the views of the surrounding area are excellent, taking advantage of the mount on which the church was constructed.    The church, itself, is a bit of a letdown. It’s not bad, but it’s not tremendously impressive inside. I would say, rather bland would describe it best. A site this bold deserves a truly majestic interior. It needs to be inspiring, one where you want to look around in awe. The church at Bom Jesus, nearby, far more successfully achieves this mating of environment and building. If you go to Bom Jesus, by all means come here, too. If you go here, you would be an idiot to not also visit the marvelous Bom Jesus, with its magnificent and mindbendingly long series of staircases down the mountain, perhaps the number one reason I wanted to visit northern Portugal. Looking at pictures on the internet, as great as they look, do not do it even a semblance of justice. My sky high expectations were not only met, but way surpassed. And if you visit the Douro Valley and you have the time, go see the similar Santuario Nossa Senhora dos Remedios in Lamego. It’s out of the way, but the drive up is fantastic and there is also a pretty good small cathedral there. Worth the time and effort.","Externally more impressive than internally","2021-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","379","0","120","116","9","117","0","613","2006-10-10T22:21:02-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.6A194774CE98DF318E53CC34B3FB93F7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","6A194774CE98DF318E53CC34B3FB93F7",,"Virginia","JJJC_Family","en","false","2021-11-02T04:13:08-04:00","5","One of the most gorgeous and unpredictable Portugal beauties!

Absolutely fantastic! The balcony, too, is a great feature. Inside there is a beautiful staircase and the granite floors are striking. There are a few artworks and other objects inside, but no furniture or other furnishings, which is a pity.  The whole building is built from fine-grained granite and you can't help admiring the fine work that has gone into all of this. However the outside of the building is probably worth admiring much more than the interior.  Worth visiting if you are nearby.","Nice front","2018-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/14/2b/bb/dimitris-l.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/14/2b/bb/dimitris-l.jpg","3723","0","0","63","2437","163","0","3949","2015-09-30T08:39:17-0400","Dimitris","L","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.AFFB511F21DF819776CB2F8013034382","en_US","0","Dimitris L","0",,"user","AFFB511F21DF819776CB2F8013034382","255060","Sydney, Australia","Dimitris L","en","false","2019-03-22T04:23:35-04:00","4","The palace is very interesting on the outside with its many azuléjos   The inside, unlike Biscainhos is not furnished.

Its current appearance dates back to the year 1772, at the initiative of Archbishop D. Gaspar de Bragança, with a project by the architect from Braga, André Soares, at a historical moment when the city broke the old walls, expanding.
It has been classified as a National Monument since the year 1910. Next to it is a medieval tower, belonging to the Fernandina wall, and practically covered by the houses.

We three middle aged Brits were staying in town three nights and this was on our list. One of us is against church or cathedral entrance fees so we split up. At around 3:30pm I bought the full €5 ticket whilst my friend bought just the Cathedral €2 ticket in the side street entrance to the cathedral complex. My ticket included a guided tour of the chapels and upper choir, scheduled at 4pm.

We both had a walk around the cathedral which is quite plain with the statues on stretchers for decorating and hauling around town during Santa Semana. The organ was the most impressive thing in the church though. My friend left and I waited for the tour.

A group of mainly Portuguese gathered and a guide took us through the complex to a series of very interesting chapels of various ages. Tiled walls, pigment decorated walls, tombs, a very wrinkly but undecomposed archbishop (it's a miracle apparently), florid walls, turkish influences, mum&dad statues above tombs, miracle fruits....

I was the only English speaker there so the guide patiently repeated everything personally to me in English whilst an apprentice listened in.

Up we went a few flights of stairs into the upper choir which was amazing! Two identical working organs were at the alter end of the rows of named seats of the choir. A 'clock' at the end was set at 3pm as that's when Christ was nailed to the cross.

Later we three rejoined and wandered round the free parts of the cathedral complex including the archbishop tombs and a chapel with lots of wax figures of heads, legs and arms....a local custom?

Altogether a very good value excursion, especially with the one to one commentary! 

The managers just really need to get rid of that rubbish euro paladin bin in the courtyard though…..","Great organ, good value combi ticket, plain interior but undressed statues ready for santa semana","2022-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/13/b9/83/a4/mike-k.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/b9/83/a4/mike-k.jpg","147","0","0","169","5079","501","0","818","2010-12-29T17:44:17-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.26D84FD64672E0892FC634B0659E56F2","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","26D84FD64672E0892FC634B0659E56F2","186338","London, United Kingdom","MikeLondonSE","en","false","2022-05-26T05:59:33-04:00","4","Impressive facade and portal but it does seem to have been hemmed in somewhat bylater additions.

There is a nominal charge to visit the church, and it will cost you a few more euros on top of that for the chapels, high choir, and museum. Go for it!

Its best documented history dates back to the work of the first bishop, D. Pedro de Braga, and corresponds to the restoration of the Episcopal and this in the year 1070, of which few traces are preserved.
In the year 1128, a building with five chapels at the apse was started, which were partially destroyed by the earthquake in the year 1135.
In the year 1268 the works were still not completed. On the outbuildings of the former house of the “Cabido”, built at the beginning of the 18th century by Archbishop D. Rodrigo de Moura Teles, currently stands the Braga Cathedral Treasure-Museum.
In the 20th century, the tomb of the religious and stigmatized Sister Maria Estrela Divina, a center of great popular devotion, was placed next to the cloisters. His collection of Sacred Relics became famous, including the piece of a Mantle of the Holy Virgin Mary, in the Chapel of Relics. There are chests containing the bones of many saints, and the so-called Holy Ark is legendary, whose contents will be remarkable, and went out in procession in the past, on days of solemn feasts.
It has been classified as a National Monument since the year 1910.","Visiting the city of Braga.","2021-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/7d/50/e2/amazon122s.jpg","1686","0","133","166","8759","222","0","2075","2011-09-25T09:37:40-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","50378359345D693C4407D02CB9C266BE","1444586","Santa Comba Dao, Portugal","hans-jaguar","en","false","2021-10-18T11:26:38-04:00","5","As the proverb says, Porto works, Braga prays, Coimbra studies, and Lisbon gets the money.

I was very impressed with the Cathedral, especially is wooden carved ceiling, the courtyard with Roman statues, with a Museum where you can see Cardinals outfits.

Or that Saint Peter of Rates was resurrected to be Braga's first bishop.  This church has a varied collection throughout history, with the first thing we noticed was the old smell.  The original structure dates from the 1000s, replacing a prior structure. 
 The main chapel from the 1300s.  The organ from the 1700s.  And a lot of history in between.

For €2 you can visit the cloisters, crypt and the cathedral itself. For €3 you can visit the museum but I didnt add that particular option.
The Cathedral is cavernous as you'd expect but still retains a homely and welcoming feel. I loved the banners hanging from the walls between the windows and the unbelievably intricate and decorative organ at the back of the nave. The altar is simple, but it has gorgeous stained glass windows flanking stand beautifully carved chorister chaurs.
Most if the visit will be spent at the gold gilted organ I suspect. It really has to be seen to be believed, as beautiful an organ as you ever will see with a beautifully painted ceiling above it.","Beautiful Cathedral ","2020-02","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/9b/a4/49/bozemandublin.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/9b/a4/49/bozemandublin.jpg","2595","0","164","239","2518","548","0","3386","2008-06-25T11:17:15-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D782011B22E0B61964AA70F9A3C92561","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","D782011B22E0B61964AA70F9A3C92561","644237","Trim, Ireland","Bozeman-Dublin","47","Sights & Landmarks",,,,,"#5 of 119 things to do in Braga","175","Churches & Cathedrals",,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189171-d318707-Reviews-Se_de_Braga-Braga_Braga_District_Northern_Portugal.html","http://www.se-braga.pt","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189171-d318707-Se_de_Braga-Braga_Braga_District_Northern_Portugal.html"

Seeing Bom Jesus was definitely worthwhile! The basilica is majestic, and although we could only peek inside because of a service in progress, walking around the grounds afforded spectacular views. Not only could we see the city, but also, walking back down allowed us to see the many chapels and sculptures. Looking back up from the bottom really gives you a sense of the scale and symmetry.

Around 4pm, the first half of the hike up the stairs is shaded so it nice and comfortable.  

Aside from the church, they also have a gift shop, cafe, ice cream shop, and keep on walking to the top (not much) to find a restaurant and a small lake where you can rent a small boat or have a picnic.   I wish I had more time, but  I only had 2 hours.

My spirits were lifted as soon as I walked into the church! Small chapels representing the stations of the cross line the sides, but it was the Crucifixion scene behind the main altar that made me gasp. Afterwards, we walked down the fabulous Baroque stairway amid fountains, statues, chapels, and gardens. I can’t imagine climbing up 600 steps on your knees as some pilgrims do! Honestly, in the rain, it was not the view or experience I was hoping for. Yet still so stunning and I was grateful to be there.

Also known as ""Santuário do Bom Jesus de Braga"", it is a symbol of the Christian faith and of the importance of the Roman Catholic Church in Portugal. Around the 14th century, a primitive ermitage was erected at the top of ""Monte de Espinho"" and it soon became a center of Christian pilgrimage. Years later, in 1784, Archbishop Dom Gaspar de Bragança commissioned Portuguese architect Carlos Luís Ferreira da Cruz Amarante the construction of the actual Sanctuary. It was finally inaugurated in 1811 and is one of the first Neoclassical constructions in Portugal, but Baroque and Rococo characteristics can also be seen. A monumental staircase and a beautiful elevator connect the lower part of ""Monte de Espinho"" to the Sanctuary itself, at its top. The staircase - with all its chapels, statues, fountains and points of observation - symbolizes the sacred route to the ""Way of the Cross"" and a rite of penitential purification. Unmissable to all those visiting Braga and, remember, Unesco has appointed the ""Santuário do Bom Jesus do Monte"", in 2019, a ""World Heritage Site""!

The tours offered are the only way to enter and inspect the museum. They are, however, quite restrictive timewise and that means you do not always get enough time to view and absorb whatever is exhibited. The guides are there more to guard, rather than guide, as well as to push visitors along and finish the so called tour on time. There are information cards in English which visitors are meant to use, but unless you are a speed reading champion you will not be able to get all the information or to actually view the objects and other things displayed. The Garden is also great and you are not rushed like in the museum.","Good museum","2018-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/14/2b/bb/dimitris-l.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/14/2b/bb/dimitris-l.jpg","3723","0","0","63","2437","163","0","3949","2015-09-30T08:39:17-0400","Dimitris","L","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.AFFB511F21DF819776CB2F8013034382","en_US","0","Dimitris L","0",,"user","AFFB511F21DF819776CB2F8013034382","255060","Sydney, Australia","Dimitris L","en","false","2019-03-22T18:01:17-04:00","5","The visit begins with a view of the gardens and then you can walk through the palace but with a guide.

No fee was charged but we were allowed to explore, the only thing asked was to light a candle for the saint of your choice, all of which had a figure and candle display in the central corridore. The candles are all electronic ones now so it is just symbolic.
Visible security is present thru all areas of the church.

Inner courtyards had displays of remnants of gravestones and historic carvings,  there was an inner glass covered central flower garden which was very pretty and let in light.

The area where services are performed was very ornate, and you were also able to view from high the buriel vault and caskets of those who headed the church in a seperate chamber.

It was an unexpected hidden jewel, an experience we wont forget.","A must see for the church itself and the historic displays","2017-10","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/d0/be/b8/chickandbeast.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/d0/be/b8/chickandbeast.jpg","1924","0","162","92","4353","440","0","2459","2005-07-18T00:00:00-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.AE35A489685998F64393B44049BA3B81",,"0",,"0",,"user","AE35A489685998F64393B44049BA3B81","10961978","Southgate, Canada","chickandbeast","en","false","2017-10-04T16:05:07-04:00","5","Must see if you are in Braga !

Det är däremot lite känt om den fortsatta utvecklingen, men man tror sig veta att muren utvidgades i mitten på 1100-talet runt ett centralt torn. På 1300-talet beordrade kung Denis att ett palats skulle byggas, arbetet gick dock långsamt och med långa avbrott. I mitten av 1800-talet började man att riva murarna, ett arbete som pågick fram till 1905 då bara centraltornet fanns kvar. Det räddades för eftervärlden och är idag den enda hela byggnad som finns kvar av Bragas slott. Delar av det gamla slottet finns dock kvar och har återanvänts i de omgivande byggnaderna, klocktornet i kyrkan Lapa är t.ex. ett torn från slottet och en del av den östra muren finns kvar inne i kvarteret.
Tornet har renoverats under 1900-talet och kan besökas, utsikten från toppen sägs vara utmärkt. När vi var i Braga var tornet öppet på eftermiddagarna, men vi tittade bara på utsidan. Väl värt ett besök, tornet ligger diskret till men ändå bara 50 m från gågatan Rua do Souto.","Gömt bara 50 meter från gågatan","2021-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1d/d9/ff/de/robert-a.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1d/d9/ff/de/robert-a.jpg","1197","0","0","147","3332","1033","0","2378","2013-04-10T15:42:07-0400","Robert","A","https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B603527FF1374EF2389CEC2058F15BAB","en_US","0","Robert A","0",,"user","B603527FF1374EF2389CEC2058F15BAB","189854","Dalarna County, Sweden","Robert A","it","false","2020-11-09T05:27:55-05:00","3","Si trova dietro la piazza principale, molto nascosta dagli altri edifici.

Construido en la parte más alta de la ciudad, aprovechando su muralla y junto a la puerta do Souto, este castillo fue mandado construir por D. Denís a principios del siglo XIV. Reformado en varias ocasiones, a mediados del XIX comienza su demolición junto con la de las murallas de la ciudad: en 1858 se derriba la puerta do Souto y la muralla adyacente.
La torre del homenaje tiene unos 30 m. de altura y cuatro pisos. Como era corriente, se accede a ella por el primero; sobre la puerta de entrada figuran las armas reales de don Denís.
Declarado Monumento Nacional en 1910, la torre fue entonces restaurada. Propiedad del ayuntamiento, hoy alberga un interesante museo sobre la historia de la ciudad.","Museo en la torre","2020-01","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/14/8f/b0/fe/francisco-javie-p.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/8f/b0/fe/francisco-javie-p.jpg","9","0","0","2","0","3","0","14","2018-09-10T12:38:12-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.418704F43CCC8327ED6D8F56C72E0BB7","es","0",,"0",,"user","418704F43CCC8327ED6D8F56C72E0BB7","644337","Ourense, Spain","Viladerrei","fr","false","2019-12-03T08:26:54-05:00","4","D’une hauteur de 30 m, ce donjon faisait partie du système de défense mis en place au début du XIVe siècle sous le règne du roi Denis du Portugal (1261-1325).

A Igreja do Hospital de São Marcos começou a ser construída na segunda metade do séc. XVIII e só foi inaugurada em 1836, como está escrito numa placa no exterior. 
O interior não é grande, fez-me lembrar a Basílica do Sameiro. Destaco o teto por cima da zona do altar.
Tem coro alto e um bonito órgão de tubos que não pude fotografar.
Tem uma rampa de acesso no exterior para pessoas em cadeira de rodas ou com dificuldade em subir/descer degraus.

Κατασκευάστηκε το 18ο αιώνα, με αρχιτέκτονα τον Carlos Amarante, εξαιτίας του οποίου πήρε το όνομά της και η πλατεία. Αρχικά, η εκκλησία αποτελούσε τμήμα του νοσοκομείου του Αγίου Μάρκου, που σήμερα όμως δε λειτουργεί πλέον. Αντίθετα, στο τμήμα του πρώην κτηρίου του νοσοκομείου, δεξιά από την Igreja de Sao Marcos, λειτουργεί από το 1916 το ξενοδοχείο ""Vila Galé"". Η ίδια η εκκλησία έχει έναν έντονο μπαρόκ χαρακτήρα και στην πρόσοψή της ξεχωρίζουν το διπλό καμπαναριό, τα μεγάλα παράθυρα και μια σειρά από αγάλματα αγίων. Μεταξύ των αγαλμάτων, κεντρική θέση καταλαμβάνει αυτό του Αγίου Μάρκου. Σύμφωνα με τους περισσότερους ερευνητές, είναι τα αυθεντικά λείψανα του Αποστόλου Μάρκου, αυτά που φυλάσσονται σε πανέμορφα διακοσμημένη θήκη στο εσωτερικό της εκκλησίας.","Μεγάλης θρησκευτική σημασίας","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","1692","0","0","37","200","240","0","1970","2017-10-17T08:56:35-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","189432","Paros, Greece","Saltpilgrim","pt","false","2022-06-20T18:50:33-04:00","5","Esta igreja data do século XVI e localiza-se no Largo Carlos Amarante, no centro histórico.

Já fazem 2 dias que lá estive e continuo com isto em mente. Honestamente, já vi servirem comida de cachorro melhor do que o Tomatino do Centro comercial Nova Arcada.

Para início o funcionário que deveria cozinhar estava a fazer algo que parecia maravilhoso mas era algo fora do menu e era apenas para ele almoçar. Belos camarões muito bem temperados mas só que para ele e outro funcionário.

Tive que esperar aproximadamente 20 minutos para ser servido 3 pratos para mim e minha família. Comprei e paguei nada barato para ver com imensa tristeza o descaso que tratam o respeito a trabalhar, a comida e o cliente. Utilizaram misturas em pó, daquelas prontas, para fazer um simples molho Alfredo.

Sinceramente me senti muito constrangido e a comida é pessíma. Não recomendo jamais e tampouco voltarei neste local.

Aproveitem IKEA, Toys R Us e outras lojas e mantenham-se o mais longe possível desse péssimo local, o Tomatino.","Shopping bom, restauração deixa a desejar.","2019-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","2","2019-07-14T18:43:54-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8CA09D7872CCA512F63D395996DBD17A","pt_PT","0",,"0",,"user","8CA09D7872CCA512F63D395996DBD17A",,,"netojcan","pt","false","2019-05-02T12:04:27-04:00","5","O Centro Comercial Nova Arcada está situado a 3,9 kms de distância do centro de Braga.

This is the remains of a 1st century complex, where there were public Roman Baths. In those days, Braga's namesake, Bracara Augusta, was a provincial Roman capital, and a very important centre. The site is not as well preserved as other similar sites, but that is a common problem in many countries around Europe where the Romans had set foot. What remains is quite interesting and with a bit of imagination and more information, you could bring back to life those amazing times. Keep in mind that excavations are continuing. As for getting there, it is not too difficult. If you have a map, or a phone app, then you should no real problems finding the site.

Depois segui para a visita às ruinas e achei muito interessante o espaço exterior, que tem a forma de um anfiteatro e que possivelmente será alvo de escavações nos próximos tempos.
Visitei as antigas Termas Romanas de Maximinos com um bilhete que também deu para visitar a Fonte do Ídolo, em frente ao Palácio do Raio, no centro da cidade, e que custou 3,35€.

There has obviously been a bit of a refurb in the last ten years which means that the seats are comfy, but there is a silly looking wooden barrier/fence around the perimeter of the stalls that looks well out of place.  

I picked the opening night performance - or Gala - for the San Joao Festival.  You should be happy that it was a one off, and you can’t make the same mistake I did.  There was one choir that made the grade - the rest of it was amateur hour interspersed with lots of back-slapping of local officials, volunteers and performers.  And an MC that gave new meaning to the word “underwhelming”.

Το 2006 έγιναν εκτεταμένες εργασίες συντήρησης και αναπαλαίωσης, ενώ διοργανώνονται και ξεναγήσεις με επίσκεψη σε όλους τους εσωτερικούς χώρους του.

A large part of the building (including the façade) was rebuilt in the late 18th century.
With the extinction of the male religious orders (1834), the complex was transferred to the hands of the State, and the convent dependencies, from the year 1841 onwards, began to house an Infantry Regiment.
Since the year 1996, the premises of the convent have been one of the buildings of the Municipality of Braga.

Ne dit-on pas de Braga qu’elle est la Rome du Portugal ? L’Igreja do Pópulo de Braga fut construite au XVIe siècle à la demande de l’archevêque Frei Agostinho de Jesus qui voulait y être inhumé. Celui-ci est décédé en 1609 mais ce n’est qu’en 1628 que son corps fut transféré dans un tombeau en bois lequel fut déposé dans une niche de la chapelle principale de cette église. À l’origine, le style artistique et architectural de l’église était plutôt influencé par le maniérisme, mouvement en vogue à l’époque suivant la Renaissance, soit de 1520 à 1580. Mais les restaurations apportées au XVIIIe siècle, notamment sur la façade, furent plutôt réalisées dans le style néoclassique.

We three middle aged British guys had some time to explore this museum. Unfortunately the nearby Roman Baths were closed because of the festival.

We crossed the giant concourse to enter the modern building and pay our €3 each for the museum.

To the right of the cashier’s desk was the first room full of Roman and Greek artefacts well lit and presented with English translations.

Passing the cashier’s desk you go along a long corridor to enter the main museum of displays and then downstairs to some more. All very impressive with some excellent models. 

We knew there was a large mosaic in the museum but there were no big signs. We were looking through a temporary exhibition of Disabled sports people and I asked my friend where the mosaic was. A worker overheard me and took me outside by the restaurant/cafe (restaurant was only open for lunch) and showed us an unlabelled ramp to the mosaics. Down we went to find the large underground square with an exhibition round the walls. The signs to this major attraction were really bad! We had a look around there four sides, a video was being shown in a room of something but there was no interpretation. The mosaic had little interpretation in Portuguese and none in English…such a shame! 

We then wandered through a children’s play and pupils’ study area, up the stairs and left. 

Altogether a good place to go to learn a free things about the area but there was not enough English translations of some important pieces and displays.","Great museum which should inspire potential archeologists.

The outside and layout is kind of modernist in intention. After getting your ticket you walk down a long corridor to the first rooms but I found the articles on the walls too small to read properly even squatting down a bit. The thrust of the modern is reflected in the minimalist explanations and designation of artefacts. The artefacts though are pretty good. However it would be nice to have had some explanation of the roman inscriptions of the stone plinths which were impressive. There are small guide notebooks on each floor but I could only find one (I was alone in the museum) but again had a real problem working out a) what exhibits they referred to and b) disappointed at the absence of any further explanations or background to the exhibits which was a shame as some were worthy. I only found out about the outside access to the roman ruins of a house by asking at reception whether I had missed anything. Similarly I had to ask where one of the key exhibits was (blue decorated silver saucer) and had to return and squat down to admire its beauty. It is a good museum but is let down mainly by the absence of background and explanations on what are in fact good displays. Didn't try the cafe as I was the only one there and it didn't seem to be open.Perhaps bad timing.","Great exhibits let down by lack of information","2016-03","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/c7/2b/ee/chasingclouds.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/c7/2b/ee/chasingclouds.jpg","73","0","17","6","52","6","0","86","2011-06-02T14:33:43-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.1C62C44895C827169355189EA8D7CB87","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","1C62C44895C827169355189EA8D7CB87",,"London","Chasingclouds","en","false","2015-06-25T02:10:02-04:00","4","I am tempted to recall the old advertising for the V&A in London: ""Ace cafe with quite a good museum attached"".

It is by no means a big or first rate museum. This is not the British Museum. Still Braga was once the capital of the northern roman province of Gaelicia, an important commercial city and was well connected by 5 roman roads that are still used to this day. Getting to know this roman past is part of understanding and enjoying Braga. If you have a longer stay in town or just love history like myself I do recommend this museum. 

1) Do request to see the introductory video (in Portuguese but you can figure out they are talking about finding and fixing archeological discoveries). Also in the patio of the museum is the entrance to a Roman house discovered when they built the museum foundations.

2) Sundays entrance is free until 2 pm. Otherwise its something like 2-3 Euro entrance. 

3) Nearby is a roman thermal bath with a video explanation also worth visiting. 

4) Around town they are roman houses, walls and a fountain idol to be visited. All part of the urban landscape.

Como vi num panfleto que me ofereceram no local, isto é um santuário rupestre de origem pré-romana, dedicado à deusa indígena Nábia, intimamente ligada ao culto da água e da fertilidade.
Foi monumentalizado no início da fundação da cidade, por um imigrante chamado Celico Fronto, que mandou executar as esculturas e as inscrições visíveis na frente do santuário.
Posteriormente os descendentes deste imigrante renovaram o monumento, construindo um lago em frente à fachada da fonte.
Na minha visita pude assistir a um curto vídeo sobre a história desta fonte, que atualmente se encontra em avançado estado de degradação, deixando perceber que ali esteve em tempos uma estátua de uma figura humana com cerca de 1,10 metros de altura e algumas inscrições.
Entre a receção e a zona da fonte existem 14 degraus o que impossibilita a visita a pessoas em cadeira de rodas ou com dificuldade em subir/descer degraus. Não vi qualquer elevador.

Probablemente sobre un santuario anterior, la fuente fue monumentalizada por Celico Fronto en el siglo I d. C. En la piedra fueron esculpidas una figura togada, a la izquierda, y, a la derecha, en una edícula con frontón triangular, un busto masculino. Son cuatro las inscripciones grabadas en la roca, dos de las cuales dan el nombre de Celico Fronto, natural de Arcóbriga –que estaría al sur de Lusitania–, dando otra el nombre de Tongo Nabiago, divinidad asociada a Nabia, diosa de la fecundidad habitualmente –como aquí– relacionada con el agua.

The buildings on the Southern side of the palace, delimited by ""Rua do Souto"" and by ""Rua Dom Diogo de Sousa"", form a small square known as ""Largo do Paço"". At its center, a beautiful fountain, the 18th century ""Chafariz dos Castelos"". As a matter of fact, it is not exactly a square, but rather a patio, as no gardens or lawns or benches are seen. Since 1973, these buildings house the rectory of the University of Minho. A quick stop, a few pictures and you are done.

The fountain is called Chafariz dos Castelos, or Fountain of the Castles. The buildings surrounding this are part of the Episcopal Palace belonging to the Archbishop. This might explain a few things! The fountain itself was not working when we visited, but it was lovely nonetheless. There are no trees or any greenery in the square, at least not when we visited. It was absolutely bare! Bear in mind that many squares in European cities are like that anyway, so that's probably no surprise! Perhaps the scene changes on special occasions.

Ανακαλύψαμε ότι η έκτασή του και ο πλούτος των εκθεμάτων του απαιτούν να έχεις σημαντικό διαθέσιμο χρόνο, ώστε να πραγματοποιηθεί μια επαρκής επίσκεψή του. Βρίσκεται στο κέντρο της πόλης, δίπλα στον μεσαιωνικό Torre de Santiago, ο οποίος ήταν τμήμα των οχυρώσεων της πόλης και σήμερα ανήκει και αυτός στο μουσείο Pio XII. Στις αίθουσες του μουσείου, μπορείτε να απολαύσετε μία από τις σημαντικότερες αρχαιολογικές και θρησκευτικές συλλογές όλης της Βόρειας Πορτογαλίας. Μεταξύ των εκθεμάτων περιλαμβάνονται κεραμικά, νομίσματα, γλυπτά, κοσμήματα, πίνακες, λιθογραφίες, θρησκευτικά κειμήλια και υπέροχα διατηρημένα ρούχα εποχής. Ξεχωριστή θέση στο μουσείο καταλαμβάνουν οι πίνακες του Henrique Medina, που θεωρείται ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους προσωπογράφους του 20ου αιώνα.","Επίσκεψη που απαιτεί χρόνο...","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","1692","0","0","37","200","240","0","1970","2017-10-17T08:56:35-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","189432","Paros, Greece","Saltpilgrim","pt","false","2022-09-04T00:26:54-04:00","5","O Museu Pio XII foi fundado em 1957 e deve o seu nome ao Papa que estava em funções nesse ano. Está instalado num edifício que pertence à Arquidiocese de Braga.
Na primeira sala começamos por ver alguns objetos encontrados em escavações arqueológicas e no tempo da ocupação romana.
Seguidamente e com maior espaço destinado, temos a vertente religiosa, com arte sacra e bonitos objetos de ouro, onde destaco os pequenos crucifixos do séc. XVII e XVIII, entre outros.
Depois ao passar pela cultura oriental, gostei de ver as moedas chinesas com mais de 2700 anos.
Gostei também da exposição permanente de pintura de Henrique Medina (1901-1988), no piso superior, especialmente as pinturas de pessoas.
O interior tem boas acessibilidades para visitantes em cadeira de rodas, mas na entrada do edifício, vindo da rua, existem dois degraus o que torna inacessível a visita, sem ajudas para os subir.
É um museu muito interessante, mas achei que está pouco divulgado, também por estar um pouco afastado da zona mais turística da cidade.
A visita ao Museu Pio XII teve um custo de 2€. Comprei o bilhete conjunto com a Torre de Santiago, que fica em frente, os dois espaços por 4€.","Belo museu","2022-08","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0f/36/48/c9/ruiferreira74.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/36/48/c9/ruiferreira74.jpg","2195","0","0","30","2008","404","0","2629","2013-08-25T04:07:06-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.DAFAA6CDD101B5C62CBBF66AB31DE3AE","pt","0",,"0",,"user","DAFAA6CDD101B5C62CBBF66AB31DE3AE","1466996","Santo Tirso, Portugal","Rui_F74","pt","false","2020-02-22T09:58:06-05:00","5","Excelente local que todos devem visitar.

Κατασκευάστηκε το 1723, με διαταγή του αρχιεπισκόπου D. Rodrigo de Moura Telles. Στην κορυφή του έχει τοποθετηθεί μια γυναικεία φιγούρα, η οποία συμβολίζει την πόλη της Braga και η οποία σηκώνει στην πλάτη μία μεταλλική σφαίρα που στηρίζει ένα διπλό αρχιεπισκοπικό σταυρό. Το γυναικείο άγαλμα στηρίζεται σε ψηλή πυργοειδή σκαλιστή βάση, ενώ χαμηλότερα συναντάμε τα έξι στόμια ροής του νερού, τα οποία έχουν το σχήμα κάστρων. Τη βάση με τα στόμια, στηρίζει στις πλάτες του μια ομάδα από putti (γυμνά στρουμπουλά αγόρια που μοιάζουν με αγγελάκια).

My husband and l had our dinner on 9/6/2019 at Macdonald during our two nights stay in Hotel Dona Sofia.

It was within walking distance from our hotel and we had a nice meal after a long day of touring.

We were served by a young man who was helpful in explaining the menu to us as we did not understand Portuguese. Our meal came after a short wait as the restaurant was rather packed when we arrived. The burgers and fries were nice and well done and comparable to those we had in our homeland. We also bought two sets of burgers for takeway for our children who chose to stay in the hotel to watch the UEFA finals . They too enjoyed the meals.

The restaurant was quite big with two levels and the upper level had a children's room and ample seats.  There wasn't many seats on the ground floor where the counter and cashier were located. It could be quite noisy when  the crowd build up. There was a row of electronic self service kiosk in the centre of the restaurant. Generally the restaurant was clean and the crew service was good .

At the back-side you have the tower of the church (who is an architectural solution typical of several Braga temples).

In April of the year 2017, conservation and restoration works began, which initially focused on the church's façade and roofs. In the second phase, corresponding to the restoration of the interior, the side altars were treated and the tiles, images, side altarpieces and floor were restored.

L’escalier monumental qui forme la Voie sacrée est l’élément central du sanctuaire dédié au Bon Jésus du Mont de Braga. Bien que depuis 1882, un funiculaire facilite l’accès à tous au sommet de la colline où a été construite la basilique, ce monument baroque a été conçu pour être visité du bas vers le haut tant pour respecter l’ordre chronologique du chemin de croix (17 chapelles) que pour l’aspect expiatoire (souffrir pour sa foi) de l’entreprise. La Voie sacrée est subdivisée en trois parties : l’escalier du portique (début du chemin de croix, un sentier sinueux à travers la forêt du parc), l’escalier des cinq sens (vue, ouïe, odorat, goût et toucher) et l’escalier des trois vertus théologales (foi, espérance et charité). Le chemin de croix se poursuit dans la montagne au-dessus de la basilique par la station des quatre évangélistes. L’eau ayant une forte symbolique dans la liturgie catholique (de vie et de mort, de sanctification et de purification, de naissance et de renaissance, etc.), plusieurs fontaines ont été installées tout le long de la Voie sacrée. Ainsi chacun des sens a été représenté par l’orifice d’où jaillit l’eau de la fontaine; ainsi pour la fontaine de l’ouïe (attraction dont il s’agit ici), l’eau jaillit des oreilles d’un personnage allégorique, des yeux pour la vue, de la bouche pour le goût, etc. Il y a 17 esplanades ou stations (terreiros) aménagés tout au long du parcours. On y retrouve d’autres belles fontaines comme celle des cinq plaies, la fontaine du pélican, les quatre fontaines des évangélistes, etc. La fontaine la plus particulière prend la forme de deux colonnes où s'enroule un serpent; l'eau jaillissant de la gueule du serpent et s'écoulant en spirale autour de son corps.","La Voie sacrée : un monument baroque où fontaines, chapelles et sculptures servent à livrer le message du « Bon Jésus »","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","1488","0","46","80","5398","337","0","1906","2013-01-16T13:46:43-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","en_CA","0",,"0",,"user","F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","155033","Quebec City, Canada","Michel_Louise_2013","ja","false","2019-11-04T03:57:28-05:00","4","美しい階段の一番下にある泉です。ポルトガル語で飲泉禁止のマークが無かったので飲めるのだと思います。昔は坂を山を登ってきたひとはここで一息ついたんでしょう。","美しい階段の一番下にある泉","2019-07","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/cf/f8/23/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/cf/f8/23/caption.jpg","2454","0","16","118","2137","132","0","2705","2012-05-27T04:46:57-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F449890A756C6550C4B42B035CBD7221","ja_JP","0",,"0",,"user","F449890A756C6550C4B42B035CBD7221","1023181","Tokyo Prefecture, Japan","Cruiser804015","pt","false","2019-09-16T08:46:47-04:00","5","A fonte da audição, está representada por uma figura que lança água pelos ouvidos, rodeada por sete castelos e por baixo três cabeças de boi.

We three middle aged guys from London just passed by and saw this tiny chapel during a Wednesday afternoon walk and entered it as part of the €5 (adult) Premium deal for the Capela dos Coimbras, Tower and Garden with drink visit . A port (red or white)/coffee & biscuits/(non alcoholic) Mango cocktail were included in the deal.

The host took us to the turnstiles of the chapel and let us through them. 

Inside was quite splendid and impressive with fascinating reliefs, tomb and tiles. The online smart qi codes came up with some information about each wall.

We exited the chapel  went back behind it to go up the stairs to the top of the tower which had a timeline display of the history of the chapel and tower, Braga and the rich family who built it. No views as the windows were all stained glass and sold but it was not high up anyway! 

After we left the tower our tickets allowed us to have the drinks in the garden (see separate review of the Jardim which is apparently a night spot! We had two ports and a coffee and biscuits as part of the deal. The cocktail should have been described as a ‘mocktail’ as no alcohol was in it. 

A nice place to visit but pricey compared to the same €5 paid for an all inclusive tour of the Cathedral (but no port unfortunately - see that review!)","Interesting small chapel with tower access& garden drink 4 €5 which is reasonable deal.No views from tower, display","2022-06","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/13/b9/83/a4/mike-k.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/b9/83/a4/mike-k.jpg","147","0","0","169","5079","501","0","818","2010-12-29T17:44:17-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.26D84FD64672E0892FC634B0659E56F2","en_UK","0",,"0",,"user","26D84FD64672E0892FC634B0659E56F2","186338","London, United Kingdom","MikeLondonSE","en","false","2019-04-29T04:39:06-04:00","5","This small chapel is situated in the center and belongs to the Coimbra manor house quite well known for its Manueline style balcony.

Incidentally, with regard to the picture, what you’re looking at is the changing room.  The kiln and steam room to the left have not survived.  They are marked on the concrete pathway to the carpark. The stone with the hole is the entrance to the steam bath, low to the ground in order to prevent steam and heat loss.  You therefore had to wriggle through the hole to reach it.

The area to the right is a small courtyard, the concave rock a small pool fed by a fountain.  It is from there you took the water to throw on the hot stones in the kiln to create the steam, much like a modern sauna.

Two pillar stones mark the entrance to the complex.","Just like a modern steam bath....","2018-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/c0/28/ef/invisipics.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/c0/28/ef/invisipics.jpg","9","0","3","5","0","1","0","15","2011-08-01T06:31:43-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FF18734042CF86CDF256C966007C7606","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","FF18734042CF86CDF256C966007C7606","1140516","Rossens, Switzerland","invisipics","en","false","2017-05-24T08:11:22-04:00","3","This is underneath the railway station head down the stairs to the car park.

Foi edificada por iniciativa de São Frutuoso, bispo de Braga e de Dume na segunda metade do século VII, sendo designada como Capela de São Salvador de Montélios. É uma capela de pequenas dimensões, em estilo pré-Românico, com traça Suevo-visigótica, aparentemente inspirada nos mausoléus bizantinos. O seu interior é considerado como exemplar único da Arquitetura da alta Idade Média Galaica. Segundo consta, o arcebispo de Compostela, Diego Gelmírez, no ano 1102, foi o responsável pelo roubo do corpo enquanto relíquia, de Dume, em Braga, para Santiago, onde foi enterrado solenemente na cripta da catedral. A catedral de Compostela celebra a solenidade litúrgica dessa transladação, ato que veio a ser designado por ""Pio latrocínio"", a 16 de dezembro. Atualmente, as relíquias podem ser veneradas no seu local original, tendo sido apenas devolvidas por Santiago de Compostela em 1966, 864 anos depois. Porém, as relíquias do santo encontram-se divididas. Uma parte encontra-se na capela original em São Frutuoso em Real - Braga, outra parte encontra-se na Sé de Braga e outra parte ficou em Santiago de Compostela. O santo pode ser venerado nos três locais. Um local que vale a pena conhecer.

Cappella piccola, a croce greca come un mausoleo bizantino, in grossi blocchi di pietra con influenze visigote è uno dei migliori esempi di architettura alto-medievale in zona e un gioiellino da non perdere. Sul retro si trova il sarcofago di São Frutuoso.

Sedan dess har stationen renoverats flera gånger. Den största ombyggnaden gjordes i början på 2000-talet då stationen fick sin nuvarande moderna överbyggnad med restauranger, butiker, en trädgård och parkeringsplatser. Byggnaden innehåller också ett museirum med ett förromerskt badhus, som man hittade under de arkeologiska utgrävningarna före arbetena.
Stationen är ändstation för tåglinjen ned mot Porto (och Lissabon) och utanför passerar många busslinjer som vi nyttjade. Vi reste till och från stationen flera gånger och hade inga som helst problem (dock var personalen i biljettkassan något sträv).
PS.

As part of the €5 all inclusive ticket to the Cathedral chapels and upper choir tour, at the end of the tour the guide let me into the top floor of this fascinating, modern museum. I was the only person inside so had enough time and peace contemplate the treasures, of which there were many. A few diamonds here, gold there and lots of silver. Unfortunately the old church was happy to exploit the human miners for each precious thing and a few dead elephants' tusks were carved into intricate scenes. My friend refuses to go into churches that charge as the treasures they have from exploitation are abundant. 

Silk archbishops' gowns, shoes, etc. etc., some you could touch ...but don't obviously as they are 200 years old!

Down several flights of steps on each floor are more precious things.... and a toilet on each floor with a lift in-between each floor.

The oldest piece was a roman column's capital. There were some C20th archbishop's regalia on show too.

On exiting the museum on the ground floor through an automatic door there is a shop which sells souvenirs but no CDs of the double organ in the cathedral itself, apparently they had run out.

Altogether a very good value deal, although the blue Braga tile fridge magnet was a bit steep at €4, hopefully it was made in Portugal....

No pics as plenty out there and I did not take any anyway.","Modern, well laid out, you get so close to objects. Well worth it as part of the all inclusive €5 tour ticket.

Αν και είναι γνωστή ως Casa Grande, το κανονικό της όνομα είναι Casa dos Cunha Reis. Κατασκευάστηκε το 18ο αιώνα από τον D. António Alexandre da Cunha Reis da Mota Godinho, ο οποίος ήταν ένας πλούσιος έμπορος κρασιού και κατείχε σημαντικές πολιτικές και θρησκευτικές θέσεις εξουσίας στη Braga. Όπως συνηθιζόταν, η μεγαλοπρεπής κατοικία που κατασκεύασε είχε σκοπό να διατρανώνει τη δύναμή του (κοινωνική, οικονομική, πολιτική και θρησκευτική). Μετά το θάνατο του ιδρυτή της, η οικία πέρασε ως κληρονομιά στα χέρια του αδερφού του ο οποίος και τοποθέτησε το μεγάλο οικόσημο της οικογένειας ψηλά, στο μεγάλο αέτωμα στο μέσο της πρόσοψης. Στον καιρό της, η κατοικία αποτελούσε μια από τις σημαντικότερες κατασκευές έξω από τα τείχη της πόλης. Ακόμη σήμερα, κοσμεί την πόλη και βρίσκεται στην ιδιοκτησία της ίδιας οικογένειας των Cunha Reis.","Σύμβολο πλούτου και εξουσίας","2022-04","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/02/4e/88/saltpilgrim.jpg","1692","0","0","37","200","240","0","1970","2017-10-17T08:56:35-0400",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","en_US","0",,"0",,"user","8FD3E230CD73FB08E4B448F0EA054FD7","189432","Paros, Greece","Saltpilgrim","pt","false","2020-07-24T02:41:16-04:00","4","É uma construção do séc.

Il a écrit plusieurs traités philosophiques dont le célèbre « Quod nihil scitur » qui figure au deuxième rang dans la catégorie ""Essais"" sur la liste des 50 œuvres essentielles de la littérature portugaise et qui aurait même inspiré René Descartes dans l’écriture de son « Discours de la méthode ».","En hommage à un grand philosophe et médecin portugais","2019-09","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/56/c2/5d/michel-louise-13.jpg","1488","0","46","80","5398","337","0","1906","2013-01-16T13:46:43-0500",,,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","en_CA","0",,"0",,"user","F123DEF6AB97F649AEFCF73F5572B1B6","155033","Quebec City, Canada","Michel_Louise_2013","pt","false","2019-09-16T08:27:07-04:00","5","Esta estátua encontra-se em frente da igreja onde Francisco Sanches foi batizado, São João do Souto.

Locate on a hill on the outskirts of the city; the farm has a stunning surrounding landscape. To the east, the Faleperra hill with the Sameiro Basilica and the Promontory of Bom Jesus; to the northeast, hillside on the Cavado riverbank, the sunny village of Amares, with the background of the mountain ranges of Geres and Cabreira; to the west, the serene valley of Cavado river elongates towards the sea; south, down the slope, the National Monument of the Sete Fontes, an ancient complex of water mines, gives access to the city Braga. We practice organic and biodynamic agriculture, where the process used does not affect the environment. Fertilizers are natural, derived from composting of organic waste. The health of the soil is essential for the health of plants, and living beings are precious in fighting pests and diseases. This allows us to display a range of certified products and high quality – fruits and vegetables, honey, handmade jams, aromatic and medicinal plants, spices, herbal teas and aloe vera. The vineyard is grounded on granitic soils and arranged in terraces along a hillside blessed with a microclimate, resulting in wines naturally influenced by the natural and environmental conditions. Careful selection of noble grape varieties– Alvarinho, Avesso and Trajadura for white wines – Vinhao for red wines, the use of natural organic processes of soil fertilization and nutrition, a careful monitoring in the preservation and phytosanitary treatment of the vineyards, plus a late harvest, with the aim of balancing levels of acidity and maturity have allowed quality harvests and wine productions.",,,"eu.portugal.northern_portugal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/15/f9/b8/laser-mediante-consultal.jpg","false","false","false","false","41.57134","6631158","Braga, Braga District, Northern Portugal","none","-8.38984","Quinta Cova da Raposa",,,"4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Braga","+351 914 536 237","Laser mediante consultal entertainmante in consultation","1","202766776","576","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0c/15/f9/b8/laser-mediante-consultal.jpg","1024","309","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0c/15/f9/b8/laser-mediante-consultal.jpg","550","2340","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/15/f9/b8/laser-mediante-consultal.jpg","4160","141","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0c/15/f9/b8/laser-mediante-consultal.jpg","250","50","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0c/15/f9/b8/laser-mediante-consultal.jpg","50","false","2016-07-20T09:28:27-0400","2016-07-20T09:19:38-0400",,"0","user",,"default","#72 of 119 things to do in Braga","attraction","119","Braga","189171","72","#72 of 119 things to do in Braga","4.5","2.7972776889801025",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"36","Food & Drink",,,,,"#72 of 119 things to do in Braga","132","Wineries & Vineyards",,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Lisbon","ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189171-d6631158-Reviews-Quinta_Cova_da_Raposa-Braga_Braga_District_Northern_Portugal.html","http://www.facebook.com/CovaDaRaposa/","https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g189171-d6631158-Quinta_Cova_da_Raposa-Braga_Braga_District_Northern_Portugal.html"
