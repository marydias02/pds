The stadium is really impressive in size and the friendliness of the staff working there shines through also. There is a really good club store to visit and there is (at the time of visit at least) an Adidas store there also. 

We had a guided tour so could not necessarily explore at our own pace, however the tour guide gave us plenty of time at each part of the tour to take photographs and take in the experience. You get taken from the stands down to the side of the pitch, before walking around the perimeter to see the dugouts. You then go into the tunnel and changing rooms, although due to COVID-19 regulations we could only see the away changing room. 

Amazingly, one of the final parts of the tour was to see the eagles that fly around the stadium on match day. We all felt this was a really unique experience and not something you get to see on your average stadium tour.

We visited the museum after the tour and wow! The museum is massive and not only documents Benfica's sporting achievements throughout history but also tells a lot of the story of Lisbon as a city too.

The tour was about 12-12 people - I think the small tours are great.  Our tour guide was great and because of the small group it went really well. 
We walked the stadium and saw the press room, visiting team locker room and met the team mascots - if you are a fan of the team and the sport then I recommend the tour.  The Museum is also a good part of the whole experience and it pulls the history of the team together - I agree that about 2 hours is what you will need for the tour and museum.

During the day, you can stroll through the neighborhood's narrow streets and check out the quaint boutiques and cafes. 

To get to Bairro Alto, take the eye-catching Glória Funicular at Liberdade Avenue. It’ll drop you off at the São Pedro de Alcântara viewpoint, where you'll get commanding views of the city.

It is centered around one main central tank and several smaller habitats spread over two floors, and showcases both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. You can even spend a night here and sleep with sharks. The building 'floats' in a bay off Parque de Nacoes in eastern Lisbon—you can walk to the oceanarium via a walkway across the water. 

This attraction is a popular stop on hop-on hop-off bus tours in Lisbon which includes audio guides in several languages.

The official app for the museum did not my download. That was very frustrating, as I really wanted to learn about the tiles on display. They also ran out of English brochures.
Just  a few tiles had placards next to them with explanations in English, so understanding where the tiles were originally installed was lacking.
The tiles on display are beautiful, the craftsmanship beyond belief.

Much of that street has parking on it (I think free but I'm forgetting) but it does fill up quickly with other museum people. We didn't use the bus but there's a bus stop almost immediately outside the museum.  There's a slight bend in the road and once you're past that, almost to the bridge, there's a metal gate opening on your left and you go through that to get to the entrance of the museum.  A fairly large line formed behind us after we got to the door so we weren't the only ones on a random Tuesday in April who decided to go!

Granted, we had 2 toddlers with us so we weren't stopping to read too much or admire too long but we were in and out in about an hour.  There is so much more than just tiles on a wall - whole large almost Church-like adorned rooms.

It's the only tile museum in the world (do we really need more than one?) but given that Portugal is so well-known for their tiles, it seems logical that Lisbon would have this museum.  It felt criminal to NOT go see it while we were there since we may never be back.  Only being €5/ea, price isn't a huge motivating reason not to go.  I have noted they open at 10am (which was consistent when we we got in) and closes at 6pm, Tuesday-Sunday.

Apparently the top thing to see here is on the top floor - the 74ft panel showing the Lisbon skyline before the 1755 earthquake.  We thought it was really cool! Not our favorite room but pretty close!

I rated this a 4/5 because for a tile museum, it is amazing.  It's just not a must-do for Lisbon and therefore, I docked 1 star.","Squarely on the ""Maybe"" List for Lisbon",2022-04,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/a0/74/9c/red-head8888.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/a0/74/9c/red-head8888.jpg,651,0,95,76,489,567,0,1297,2009-10-11T21:22:47-0400,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.0CC7BF5BB39914C13B10412444509C27,en_US,0,,0,,user,0CC7BF5BB39914C13B10412444509C27,60878,"Seattle, Washington",redhead_roaming,en,FALSE,2023-02-21T10:15:33-05:00,5,"Take bus #728 from Cais de Sodré, watch for the Lidl supermarket sign on left, get off and walk up past Lidl.

Some of the conserved tile segments are, indeed, beautiful and worth seeing. But the museum experience is so diminished by: 1) it closes at lunchtime but the industrial neighborhood is in the outskirts of town so there is nowhere for visitors to have lunch , relax, etc. You have to plan your trip around the staff lunch, amazing since they need to attract more visitors and revenue, not turn people away. Literally, when we visited, they ushered hundreds of people out at 1 pm, presumably so the staff could eat lunch, To make matters worse, the sign at the entrance and several on-line sites indicate the museum stays open and doesn't close. We only learned of the closing when guards alerted us. 2) the physical facility is in decline - bathroom hand dryers, faucets, audio APP, etc. don't work, 3) the on-site cafe is disappointing, a few sandwiches and expresso, and the adjacent garden is shaded for summer sun but in off-season is just gloomy.

Tile is an important aesthetic in Portugal and the museum was highly rated. On the plus side, there were some very impressive displays of tiles. The highlight of the museum is the panorama of Lisbon done in old tiles. It was fun locating places we had visited on the ‘map’. I think the museum is absolutely worth the effort to visit – but there are a few things I wanted to see but didn’t: There was almost nothing on how tiles are made, nothing about the progression of colors available and which chemicals were needed to make the colors, and very little on the early blue and white tiles.

There's also a complete gilded chapel and reliquary that shares the building.

We noticed a conservator in a small workshop and we're also slightly disappointed we couldn't find more information on azulejo restoration. The café is as beautiful as the exhibits, and we enjoyed lattés and a slice of carrot cake.

This route took about 7 minutes. The entrance to the museum is at the side of the church (see google maps). I stayed for 1 ½ hours. Note the hours for the Museum as they are not continuously open during the day. There is a covered, shady courtyard café for sandwiches (2E), coffee (1E), pastries, and a gift shop which didn’t have any inexpensive tiles (under 5E) to buy as souvenirs. 
 
Inside the museum, the tiles were displayed on walls on 2 floors. The tiles had bilingual labels including English which included the year and location where the tile had been placed. An information board briefly explained the history of Portuguese tiles -  the designs used in Islamic and European motifs, where they were used, and the preferred colors.  A display case showed the steps in creating and coloring the tiles. The tiles on display ranged from single tiles to 2x2, 4x4, etc., to wall/carpet tiles framed with a frieze/frame. While the Islamic inspired tiles had interesting geometric designs, the ones with European inspired motifs caught my attention with their landscape and daily life scenes. One of the carpet tiles using a European motif showed the wedding of a chicken with the chicken in the carriage being driven by animal coachman. What a laugh! Of course, the church wanted wall tile carpets with religious scenes and these too were on display. The amount of tiles on display was staggering! There was also a short documentary video on the history of Portuguese tiles showing many insitu. 

 From the 2nd story there was a balcony that allowed visitors to view the interiors of the church, Igreja Madre Deus, and then after actually enter the church. It was eye candy! Not only were the lower portions of the walls tiled with religious scenes, above those tiles and, even, the ceiling was covered in gilt framed paintings. Gilt details abounded around the altar. It was great to see the wall tiles insitu.

The entrance fee was a reasonable 2.50E for seniors.

It was a great choice for an afternoon. The museum is housed in a fabulous modernist building designed by the Portuguese architects- Ruy d’ Athouguia, ALberto Pessoa and Pedro Cid. The building sits on a beautifully landscaped 7.5 hectare urban site a few subway stops from the center of Lisbon. The campus is a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. 

The collection is the personal collection of the benefactor Calouste Gulbenkian. It spans time from Egyptian art through the Impressionist period with a focus on Islamic art. The Islamic section is particularly notable for the huge windows that allow the natural surroundings of the site to complement the art. In addition to the main collection is there is a fabulous Lalique room. Gulbenkian was, apparently, the largest single collector of Lalique items.

Downstairs is a nice cafeteria style eating area that also opens onto the landscaped surroundings.

He collected beautiful art works in Syria, Iraq ,Turkey  and the Far East then added European art to his holdings including works of Rembrandt, Rubens and the furniture of French 17th-18th century royalty.

The building is quite spectacular, and is probably the biggest highlight. The gardens; clearly once cherished now feel a bit run down and shabby. It's great that the grounds are free, and lots of local families were enjoying the space, which was nice.

Nuno Alvares Pereira. This church was known as one of the most beautiful Gothic temples in Lisbon until the earthquake of 1755, which caused serious damage to the building and destroyed almost all of its religious-artistic contents. Its re-construction began in an experimental Gothic style in 1756 and stopped in 1834, when the religious orders were abolished in Portugal. In 1863, royal architect, Joaquim Possidonio da Silva, founded the Portuguese Civil Architects Association. About one year later, in 1864, the Carmo Archaeological Museum was installed there for the storage and display of important sculptures from old ruined buildings.

Tickets were €5/adult and our not-quite-2 year old twins were free.  They are closed Sundays and the hours vary slightly depending upon the time of year.  Most people recommend less than an hour here so we budgeted 45 minutes and that was about perfect.  Just enough time to get inside, run around, read some of the signage, pet some kitties and take off.

This was on our must-do list for Lisbon once I was done researching but it certainly was not something I had heard about prior to doing any research.  We saw a lady doing some sweeping and my daughter was super interested in it.  The lady was so sweet to her as my daughter tried to help her sweep.  We saw a kitty lounging in the sunlight, taking in all the pets that people offered.  They have fake grass laid out, which is pretty smart, given the number of people and the ability (or non-ability) to maintain it there. There are a few mirrors leaning against the columns (maybe for helping take fun pictures??) that seemed impractical and dangerous.  While we didn't go at night time, there are a number of lights on the ground for uplighting and we could see this beautifully lit up at night from our hotel room.

The slightly irritating thing about this place is that you are told it's stroller friendly but that's only once you're inside the church.  To get inside, even down to the ticket counter, there are a set of steps.  I literally do not know if there's any other way to get down to the ticket counter (which is at the entrance to the church) other than to go down there half-moon shaped steps.  So we had to carry our stroller down those.  Then there is theoretically a wheelchair lift to go from where you get your tickets into the church but with just a stroller, we're not going to use it.

Lisbon is a very walkable city albeit with some challenging inclines. You must explore the Alfama district but be prepared to get lost then be enthralled by views over the city below.  
We used the Metro and Main Line Train to visit Belem but otherwise walked everywhere, covering 12miles in the day. The history and viewing the heritage sites are well worth the exercise.
There are many excellent cafes, bars and restaurants all reasonably priced. We had a memorably delicious evening meal at the famous Sao Bento steak restaurant. Go there if you can.

Each has its own entrance from the central courtyard. We used bus 760 to get here as it has a most convenient stop right in front of the palace entrance.  I rated the Palace d'Ajuda around 3 1/2 to 4 stars, while the Royal Treasury would deserve 5 stars.

We used 1 hour visiting the many different rooms in the palace. We had seen similar rooms with similar decor in other palaces.  For example, rooms included the expected Throne Room, Reception rooms, State dining room, and the royal apartments with bedrooms, music and sitting rooms, dining table set for the family, a billiards room, and an austere family Chapel. Each room had a bilingual sign with English which provided information about the room and special objects in it.

  The public rooms looked very regal with red velvet drapery, woven Belgium wall rugs, silk wall coverings, gilt architectural details, royal portraits hung on the walls, lovely ceiling paintings, and sparkling lit chandeliers with oversized Ming type vases in many rooms. In the private palace rooms, one room had decorative Meissen porcelain around the backs of chairs, around the frame of a standing mirror, and around candle holders on a tall stand. As we got to the end of 1 wing, the rooms began to look a bit ""worn""/uncared for with ripped upholstery on a chair, and shredding silk wall coverings in one corner. The staff keep the shutters over the windows to keep the light out. WC is at the exit only. 

Across the courtyard, is the entrance to the Royal Treasury Museum. Read my review in Tripadvisor for that attraction under, “Museu Do Tesouro Real”. The display of jewels and silver was excellent. Entrance fee was 7.50E; we stayed for ½ hour to view this display. 

The palace has no garden as it is surrounded by streets. However, there is samll garden almost across the street from the Royal Treasury Museum. It is the Jardim Botanical d'Ajuda. Entrance is around 2E. Something else to see while at the Palace d'Ajuda.  

It took us about 30 minutes to reach the palace from Comercio Square using bus 760. The palace is not central, more in the Belem area.",Typical 19C palace rooms.

The Pantheon is in fact the Church of Santa Engratia which was started as early as 16c by orders of Princess Maria, daughter of King Manuel.
However, it was finished only in 20 c and saw a very turbulent history - the first Church collapsed, then the main architect of the second Church died leaving it unfinished, then it was converted into barracks and arms factory when religion was banned in 19c. Finally it was finished in early 20c becoming a National Pantheon.
Famous figures of Portugal modern history are buried here, whose tombs you can visit in side rooms, while historic figures from discoveries period have their cenotaphs here in the main hall, but are buried elsewhere.

People brought their drinks and perched wherever there was space on the wall beside the water. It was quite lovely.
The bridge was completed in 1966 and, at 3.2km, it's still the longest suspension bridge in Europe. It took 3,000 workers but it was completed 6 months earlier than expected. It’s not a pedestrian bridge and, with the exception of an annual half-marathon, you can only cross the bridge by car or train. 
It is named after the  Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, a military coup, with widespread popular support overthrew the dictator and paved the way for a democratic Portugal.

Having read mixed reviews we weren’t sure what to expect but honestly, we had a lovely visit. 

The place itself is a bit out of the way - lots of recommendations of how to get there via metro and tram etc but we found a Bolt was the cheapest and easiest option by far. We did get the tram back into town afterwards - mainly for the experience - but the Bolt on the way there was actually cheaper, €5.96 from Saldanha to LX Factory and took about 20 mins. 

LX Factory is filled with independent shops and food places - there is a Main Street and then if you go inside the building itself you’ll find more independent businesses upstairs to peruse, as well as some round the back off the Main Street.

We had brunch at Cafe Nino, the cutest little breakfast spot run by the friendliest lady (the matcha pancakes are a must!) then went exploring. There are bookshops, tinned fish shops, some beautiful ceramic shops, jewellery and clothing, lots of foodie places. We loved it actually, the sun was shining so perfect weather to wander - we spent a good 2-3 hours there. 

LX Factory is worth a visit as part of your day; it was quiet when we first arrived around 11am and was bustling by the time we left with people drinking in the bars, doing some shopping, having a wander round. 

Definitely a good little spot to visit if you have the time - good weather is a must!",Lovely spot to see when visiting Lisbon,2023-02,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/2b/ac/1d/caption.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/2b/ac/1d/caption.jpg,12,0,5,9,0,55,0,76,2013-10-26T11:20:53-0400,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.57E6F05FAD9BB72D7B0A7B0C86ACB01C,en_US,0,,0,,user,57E6F05FAD9BB72D7B0A7B0C86ACB01C,187069,"Manchester, United Kingdom",hollivy,en,FALSE,2023-02-01T10:09:58-05:00,3,"My husband and I stopped by LX Factory a couple of hours before a dinner reservation.

The park is an uninteresting green city space with a zig zag line of clipped boxwood hedges running in the middle of its grassy area and along its sides, keeping people out of this grassy area. On either side is a patterned cobblestone sidewalk, lined with trees and a couple of benches. The view is at the top end of the park which is on a hill. It would be an uphill walk from the Pombal Statue and probably not a comfortable one on a hot day. Fortunately, our tour bus stopped at the top of the park where the attraction is  – the free viewpoint. Even at ground level, visitors can see directly down the grassy area to the tall city buildings around the Pombal Statue and, then, out towards the Tagus River and beyond it to the other side. Up on the observation deck of the skinny tower called, the Monument to the 25th April Revolution, the view over the tree tops would include the Castello Jorge. Beside the tall skinny tower is a fountain, that I am sure has some symbolic meaning, but it is ugly because it looks as if it is still in the construction stage. The huge Portuguese flag behind the fountain is only an impressive sight on a breezy day.  Interestingly, the park was named after the British king, King Edward VII, who visited the park in 1903. Our guide said that in October a Book Fair is held in the park.

Well, it was extremely great value. We followed the route designated, looked at some wonderful history and read great explanations and descriptions of what we were looking at. 

Eventually, we reached the end; being the towers and the great views of the city.

We were very relaxed during our self made tour and took two hours to take in so much information on the history of the most iconic and important 12th century building in Lisbon.

The staff we met were extremely helpful an friendly. We also visited the shop, which is at the end of the visit, that takes you back to reception, in which the staff there were just as friendly and helpful.

We think we saw about as much as we could in one visit; understand they also do guided tours, if preferred. If we visit the city again, would definitely revisit the monastery and church.

Once inside, there is the downstairs level with replica cannons to see (ok, but very plain and just cannons), then a flight of stairs up to the open first level. Here you can take photos of the main part of the tower and out onto the river, but you are not high up.
You then join another queue to wait to go up the tower. This turns out to be in several sections, the most interesting of which is the loggia balcony on the next level, which has good photo opportunities but is very small so crowded. You have to queue each time you change level, as the only access up or down is a single narrow spiral staircase. But you have to do every section once committed, even though to be honest those above the loggia, especially the chapel at the top, are nothing memorable at all. Then you queue to get back down to the open level (but luckily not for the final stairs to the entrance).

The only caution is the Tuk Tuk drivers, we were in the very same spot Wednesday afternoon and took a Tuk Tuk to our Airbnb for €10, on Saturday night they quoted €20 for the same two people (grandmother and child). Needless to say we declined (the Uber was €3,25) as the Tuk Tuk drivers kept lowering their prices for us to no avail. Expect to pay around 3 times the price of Uber for the Tuk Tuk (which has been typical all week) but 6 times is ridiculous.",Great spot for evening views,2022-04,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/25/1a/a9/cd/terri-ann-t.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/25/1a/a9/cd/terri-ann-t.jpg,37,0,2,13,3,67,0,117,2015-06-20T17:19:24-0400,Terri Ann,T,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.1AE87F208CC5ED85782B5A83E40182C9,en_CA,0,Terri Ann T,0,,user,1AE87F208CC5ED85782B5A83E40182C9,154983,"Brantford, Canada",Terri Ann T,en,FALSE,2022-02-19T02:40:32-05:00,4,"A pretty view and gorgeous tiles.

It was our last chance in Lisbon to go inside this church. We didn't know of its closure until we saw the sign on the door. We were limited to examining the detailed carvings of an exterior church door which faced the street. Between the doors was a statue of Prince Henry. Above him were intricate carvings of exotic plants and animals that explorers had seen on their journeys. Images of twisted rope surrounded a high window. These carvings, done in the 16C, looked eroded and, being so high up, I needed my telephoto camera lens to see the skilled craftsmanship. Since this church was one the seamen visited prior to their leaving Lisbon on ships, the replacement of the usual religious images for exotic lands are explanatory.  Also this church was paid for by the spice trade, particularly pepper.  
 
This church, which should be closed only on Mondays, has free entry. It is the Cloister that requires a fee. There was a line-up to visit the Cloister, probably longer than usual, as the Church was closed on the Tuesday we visited. This church is attached to the Jeronimos Monastery.

It’s free to enter the church but will have to pay €10 for the cloisters. If you are wondering whether it’s worth doing both, I’d highly recommend visiting the cloisters also. They are very different and it is the cloisters that is the highlight. The church has some very interesting features but overall, it is rather gloomy and dark and does not prepare you at all for the magnificence of the cloisters and monastery grounds.
What you’ll see in the church are the tombs of the explorer, Vasco da Gama who died in India in 1524, the poet, Luís de Camões (died 1580) and King Manuel I (died 1521). You’ll also see a very striking ceiling, spanning an extraordinarily wide central nave (30m). The ceiling is a single span with ornamental branch-like tracery vaults.  Together, the vaults and the tall, slender trunk-like pillars that support the roof, create an overall effect that made me think of a forest.
If you are visiting the cloisters, make sure to find the viewing area where you get a special vantage point, looking down over the interior of the church towards the altar.
TIPS:
* There are 2 lines. The longer line on the right is for free entry to the church and the left hand line is for the cloisters. Here’s the catch - a cloisters ticket, doesn't get you into the church. You’ll have to exit the monastery grounds and line up again. We arrived early and went to the cloisters first but this was a mistake. By the time we came out of the monastery, the church line had grown much longer. If you're there early, I'd recommend visiting the church first when the line is likely to be shortest.

The representative southern portal, created by João de Castilho, is 32 m high and 12 m wide.  At the very top, the Archangel Gabriel watches over the eaves. The 24 nearly life-size figures, the apostles, saints and bishops are all under a canopy. The architect  created one of the most beautiful and unusual interiors in Portugal. The ribs open up from six slender columns,  to support the mesh vault at a height of 25 m.  Due to the rich structure, the columns look almost weightless and without a support function. Though this structure may seem fragile, it survived not only for nearly 500 years, but also a major earthquake in 1755 . Below the gallery, on the north side, is the Vasco da Gamas sarcophagus.

Entrance was free and there were large crowds, so it was a little hard to navigate, but we were awestruck by the unbelievably high vaulted ceiling and the grey stone with lovely decorative roping that ran up the columns and across the ribs in the vaults above. There were a number of tall, thin stained-glass windows in really deep colors which did not  let in a lot of light, so the church had that dark, medieval feel.  The main altar combined gilt and marble with beautiful artwork.  Tombs of Vasco da Gama and Lagos Henriques (foremost Portuguese poet) are located in the back of the church.   The sacristy is the hidden gem—and they do charge admission for it (1.5 Euros), but it was definitely worth it.  The most distinctive feature is the column in the center of the room.  Springing from the top of it are the ribs of the vaulted ceiling.  Four additional columns connect to the central one via their vaulted ribs.  Because the ceiling is low in this room, it was easy to see the ribbed vaulting close up, rather than having to see it from so far away (like in the main sanctuary).

Apparently it took 3,300 workers and 18 months to build it which I found an astonishingly short period of time. 
 It is named after the famous explorer, Vasco da Gama, who 500 years earlier in 1498 discovered the first sea route between Europe and India. He sailed via Africa at a time when no-one was really very sure whether the Indian and Atlantic Oceans were even connected. This was a game-changer and meant that all trading, including valuable spices, could now be done by sea instead of being trekked overland from India so it’s very appropriate that the bridge is named after him.",17+ Km of Bridge,2020-03,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg,1481,0,0,38,405,314,0,1833,2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2,en_US,0,,0,,user,7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2,186216,United Kingdom,Mairwen1,en,FALSE,2021-01-24T15:38:30-05:00,5,"One of the most interesting bridges I have had the pleasure to cross.

Has anything been improved ?

The parking has become a bit better but the rest nothing has really changed.

The local drivers are really bad drivers and drive very fast, too fast in all situations. They really are bad drivers and e.g. turn corners in crossings without any consideration for crossing pedestrians.

The smokers on the street stand in clusters and at restuarants they show no concidertaion at all to non smokers. They even smoke cigars at the restuarants!
Stop all smoking outdoor at restaurants. Then all cigarette butts are trown on the streets.
At the two big malls in central Lisbon, there are smoking areas at the entrances/exits and they realy contaminate the suroundings and bad air spreads through the exit doors to the malls!!!

Is this behaviour really the Portuguese cultur to be proud off?
Sharpen up, improve, behave with consideration. Follow up.
Who are responsible? The local politicians?

All this is really disgusting.

Review from 2014

What so great about this run down street in a run down city....
Many buildings looks like after a raid during World War II. What are the authorities doing?

A lot of dog excrement every where, people spitting and slippery cobblestones all over this run down city, car parked wrongly all over on the sidewalks making it almost impossible to walk with a stroller, crazy men and women drivers everywhere, small filthy restaurants severing this food from ancient times named bacalau swimming in undefined oil.... Is this what is left of the old Portuguese culture is this the proudness of Portugal....

What are the authorities doing to stop the city's decay... who is implementing any laws who is following up, is there any program to self improve this situation... It is sorrowful to see......",Nothing has really improved.,2020-09,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,89,0,134,76,51,698,0,863,2009-02-28T03:26:17-0500,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.C19C8A4B785837B62AFA44ED7BCADD08,en_IN,0,,0,,user,C19C8A4B785837B62AFA44ED7BCADD08,294217,"Hong Kong, China",Tomberra,en,FALSE,2020-08-08T15:08:59-04:00,5,"The most beautiful avenue of Lisbon.

There is also high end shopping available along this avenue.

I hope the details below will help anyone in future if they decide to visit .They should be more direct .
Get the number 15 tram from Praça Comércio heading towards Belém .
Get off the tram at Estacao Sto Amaro stop ,this is after you have gone under the bridge . Cross the tram tracks ,you will now be in front of the Carris tram museum .Follow the tram tracks in the direction of Belém for a few hundred yards until you reach a street on your left named Travessa Do Conde Da Ponte .Go down this street .At the bottom of this street you reach a hotel called Vila Gale Opera .Turn left across the front of the hotel ,you should now be on a main road under the bridge .The entrance to the Pilar 7 is on your left .
It is a fascinating place to visit with a good insight into its construction ,the viewing platform has a glass floor that gives great views up and down the river .If you do not want to go on this you can still go up in the lift and see the views from a less scary position .Keep hold of the tickets you are issued as you need to scan them several times on the way round and go through some airport style security scanning of bags etc .There are no cafe facilities but there are toilets and bag lockers .

The weather did not help that day. It was pouring and cold and the noise of the passing traffic just intensified my fear. I promised my kids I would do it. Took a few minutes until I walked in with my eyes closed. When I opened them and looked down I was rooted with fear to the spot and could not move.

Probably a good idea to wear shoes with solid tread on the soles, as some of the little pathways, especially in the Warm Greenhouse and Sweet Greenhouse, are carpeted with tiny little pebbles, which could make for a ‘slippery’ experience. 

Good signage. Lots of benches along the pathways. WC in the Cold Greenhouse. Excellent brochure, with a map of the complex, available in both Portuguese and English. Very helpful lady at the ticket office.  Lovely way to spend a few hours!

Hours open
Daily:
10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (summer)
09:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (winter)

Estufa Fria is located in Parque Eduardo VII, so it’s easy to access by either metro or bus. Most visitors will arrive at the bottom of the park, facing the monuments at the top of the hill. There are paved lanes on either side of the large, central ‘maze’ garden.

The pathway to Estufa Fria is off from the left lane, approximately opposite the large Carlos Lopez Pavilion on the right side of the park.",Three in One!,2021-07,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,495,0,126,48,2039,37,0,581,2008-10-08T19:37:50-0400,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.718A56C45090EF0FAB8D64A664024EAB,en_US,0,,0,,user,718A56C45090EF0FAB8D64A664024EAB,154945,"Victoria, Canada",starlightShanghai,en,FALSE,2020-11-02T06:37:22-05:00,5,"If you like nature, peace and tranquility, this is an unmissable place.

First room with little science experiments/observations; make a giant bubble, play with putting obstacles in the way of the light, observe a tornado forming, etc.. Definitely more fun for the older ones, but the little was happy just to touch things.
Second room, the biggest fun, the most time spent. Put on a velcro suit and jump on a sticky surface to get stuck, drive a car with square wheels, try the fakir's bed. For the younger ones; climbing wall, lily pad piano, springy ride race and so on.
Downstairs they have an installation about the importance of water and activities about it.
They also have a big robot/ electricity themed room. It is a very hands-on room with tons of longer, more devoted activities, like make flying paper creations, sew a little creature, put together basic circuits. They have a lego robot building section and a field where you can control two bigger pretty serious programable robots.

The Miradouro de Santa Luzia just a few meters away actually has a much nicer environment than does the Miradouro das Portas do Sol. Of course, the view there is rather limited as well, but the ambience is considerably nicer than that of the Miradouro das Portas do Sol.

It roughly translates as ‘viewpoint’.
This is the most photographed viewpoint in Lisbon. The large, open terrace is almost like a balcony, looking out across Lisbon. From here you get an expansive view over the red terracotta rooftops of the Alfama, looking down across Lisbon to the water. 
I wish we’d known a little more of what we were looking at while we were there. For future reference:
* the statue in front of the view is St Vincent, patron saint of Lisbon. 
* the large building on the skyline is the monastery of Sao Vicente de Fora. 
* the chalky-white dome is the Pantheon (or the church of Santa Engrácia) 
* the white church in the distance is the Baroque church of Santo Estevão (St Stephen).
Before you leave, don’t-miss the hidden tunnel and Santa Luzia. The tunnel is tucked away below the lookout and is covered in a colourful, fun mural that tells the history of Lisbon in cartoon panels (look for the set of stairs to the right of the statue). 
Santa Luzia is basically next to the lookout and if you go around the back of the church there’s another lookout point. It’s less expansive but gives a different angle however what makes it really special, are the beautiful panels of traditional blue and white azujelos tiles. 
GETTING THERE: It’s very easy to get here and I’d highly recommend catching the famous #28 tram which takes you right to the lookout. It is also an excellent starting point for exploring the St Jorge Castle. From here, we walked about 10-15 minutes uphill, following the brown ‘Castelo de S.Jorge’ signs.",Panoramic Lookout & A Hidden Tunnel,2020-03,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/40/9c/bc/avatar.jpg,1481,0,0,38,405,314,0,1833,2018-03-05T15:54:22-0500,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2,en_US,0,,0,,user,7F63DCAEEEA021519820647CD939E5C2,186216,United Kingdom,Mairwen1,en,FALSE,2020-07-01T03:51:54-04:00,5,"Amazing view of the old city.

You’ll get a much more interesting and nuanced take than what the museum provides.

Here’s what I wrote to the museum after having visited:

To whom it may concern,

I visited your museum recently and would like to give you feedback.

While I loved the digestible nature of the content you provided, I was appalled to see how your curators completely ignored the atrocities committed against Indians during the voyages of de Gama, de Albuquerque, and de Almeida. There's no mention of the Meri, for instance. And there's no mention of the effects of Portugal's colonialism. And the considerable contributions of Jewish intellectuals are also completely omitted.

I was also horrified to see such a laughably short treatment of Portugal's role in the slave trade. I am an American and we have an abominable history of ignoring the effects of the slave trade and our role in perpetuating this horrible insitution. But at least we are making efforts.

Your museum's selective displays are one more example of Europeans' enduring refusal to look at their history honestly. In my mind, Germany is the only country to have courageously taken accountability for their past sins (though they have much work to do regarding their violent colonialist history). What's omitted is reflective of your conviction of your cultural supremacy. While there is much to admire in your collective achievements, your determination to ignore your country's oppression of other peoples, and how you benefited from that oppression, is depressing and beneath you.

Europeans constantly assert that they value the pursuit of knowledge, but it's hard to believe they truly do when I see such intentional erasure. Take some responsibility, for god's sake.

As a museum you have a sacred duty to share the good and the bad of your people's history. You do a disservice to your citizens, to tourists, and to humanity at large by hiding your country's sins. Again, as an American, I know that we are guilty of the same. We need to do better, and you need to do better.",Considerably lacking,2022-05,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2022-05-17T13:29:05-0400,Amelia,T,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.D04BAE1E819A35E409E23368C5A856CB,en_US,0,Amelia T,0,,user,D04BAE1E819A35E409E23368C5A856CB,,,Amelia T,en,FALSE,2022-05-16T02:08:31-04:00,5,Agree with other reviews that this museum offers a unique collection of historical and technological evidence which explains the great seafaring Portugese achievements.

There is not much about their discovery of Newfouland, nor about codfishing, so important to the country's survival ( the small Bacalhau museum on Commercio square is way more interesting on that subject).

It doesn’t seem to follow the same pattern of decorative perfection that most other churches in the city do.

There’s something about St. Dominic’s that conjures up in my mind two images. One image, of a young girl - blessed with all the innocence and beauty of youth. The other, of a very old woman - now devoid of youthful beauty, but blessed with all the wisdom of age.  Each is beautiful in her own way. 

Youth is like a blank canvas, with the lines of life yet to be etched on it. On the other hand, age is like the canvas that has recorded all the scars that come with the passage of time and a life lived.

To me, St. Dominic’s is like the old woman: beautiful, but not in the conventional sense.

And, with that, I hope St. Dominic will forgive me for not using a male in my analogy. :-)",Beauty in a different way.,2021-07,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,495,0,126,48,2039,37,0,581,2008-10-08T19:37:50-0400,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.718A56C45090EF0FAB8D64A664024EAB,en_US,0,,0,,user,718A56C45090EF0FAB8D64A664024EAB,154945,"Victoria, Canada",starlightShanghai,en,FALSE,2021-07-23T03:23:45-04:00,4,Excellent interior.

So many animals to see, lots of beautiful photo opportunities.  We were very blessed with warm weather when we went on the 11th January, this added to our enjoyment. Lots of animals basking in the sun so made taking photos easier! The signage coupled with the map handed out on entry made finding everything really easy. It's an incredibly large zoo and even though there were lots of people we were never in a crowd, seeing everything was as if we were the only ones there. I can imagine in the height of summer, it would be a very different story. 

We enjoyed reading all the info on all the enclosures and how vulnerable a lot of the species are. Makes you realise just how precious they are. 

We arrived just after opening at 10am and made sure we visited the dolphin show at 11. It was magnificent. The keepers clearly love the animals and you can see the bond between them. 

We stayed until about 2pm then left to have lunch before leaving the zoo.

It's official name is King Dom Pedro IV square, whose tall obelisk statue is in the middle. Two beautiful fountains adorn it on both, north and southern side from the statue, along with the National Theater on the northern side as well.
However, its main feature is the ""Wave"" cobblestone pattern (every square in Lisbon has a different pattern) of ""Calcada Portuguesa"". This is the famous pattern you see on Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro and in Senate Sq in Macao.

When the market closes, head to the next-door dining hall (Time Out Market), where there are over 30 stalls showcasing the best of Lisbon's culinary scene. Curated by Time Out’s food writers and editors, you'll find street food vendors and Michelin-star chefs serving up traditional Portuguese fare, seafood, pizza, ice cream, and more.

The prices here are accesible for everyone and the dishes cover all tastes, wheather it’s drinks or food, both local & international: cocktails, freshes, smoothies, pastries, appetisers, all sorts of meet and sea fruits cooked or grilled.
We arrived at noon when the market was very crowded.

We were there to see the Michael Bublé concert (an amazing show it was too), but when I asked for a gin & tonic at the bar, besides the 6€ for the G&T, they wanted another 1€ non-refundable for the plastic 'glass'. I mean, seriously? Who drinks G&T out of a plastic 'glass'. And charging the extra 1€ is not going to save the whales, as the plastic galss was used anyhow. Its just another way of bumping up the price. To top off the insult, the bartender told me they didn't have any lemon (or lime) to put in the drink! Really? It's just not going to happen... I had a beer.
The mens and ladies restrooms were also undergoing renovation (which I understand as necessary once in a while), but to ask guests to use the facilities whilst the work is on-going (half-finished) is a bit too much.

The festival took place on 2 different days, from 16.00 to 01.00, so imagine having to inhale the smoke for so many hours.

It takes you through the stressful, dangerous, and inspiring resistance to the eventual liberation with the fall of Salazar in April 1974.

Even the Lisbon Story Centre nearly ends it's main section on that note, consigning just one room to the history of the square it's on in general. 

This is a roundabout way of saying that, with the Museum of the Republic/Presidency in Belem closed for renovation, this was the only museum in my 4 days here that actually addressed the modern political history of Portugal in it's capital city, and very effectively too. While I think I may have appreciated more background information before diving straight into the dictatorship (I think they assume you know more of the basics than I did), it overviews the principles of the Estado Novo, it's awful tactics for squashing dissidents, it's policies at home and abroad, and the resistance actions that would add up to defeat the regime in the 1970's very well. The prop work on the second floor deserves special attention, and it is a little chilling to remember that you're standing in the same building so many atrocities occurred at decades ago.

Repression of the population was paramount.  Did you know the dictatorship took advice on torture from pre-war Nazi Germany, from the nationalists in Italy, and from the CIA ?  Of course there was an underground movement for democracy, which eventually resulted in a populist coup in Portugal, and de-colonisation too.

But there's so much more to this museum, and you'll need a minimum of an hour and a half to do it justice.

Almost 4 hours later we walked out.....  Many people know of the history of Portugal from the exploration periods in the 1500-1800's but not a lot know about it's history in the 1900's.  In order to truly understand so much of this country, this museum gives a lot of perspective into the much more recent past.  Our visit here also coincided with the inclusion of ""The Three Marias"" exhibit which was an amazing experience for our young daughters.  While the location and building as a prison dates back to Roman times, the largest part of the museum is about the reign of the Estado Novo - a corporatist/fascist/dictator era in Portugal from the 1930's until its overthrow in 1974.  This regime was highly brutal and aggressive with its imprisonment and torture of dissidents of the regime for decades.  It's longest standing head having had close relationships with Hitler and Mussolini should give some indication of the outcome if not the original intention of the regime.  To see the information that in 1970 (the year before I was born) that in Portugal only 47% of the people had running tap water, 64% had electricity and 60% had sewage pipes leads you to understand just how far behind the development of the rest of Europe and the US this country really was under this brutal regime.  The fear and memories still live within the older generation and per local friends, is slowly being removed from subsequent generations.  The country now is far from these 1970 statistics and the scarring left behind on its people is fading but definitely not completely gone.  This museum is a strong reminder of the past that must not be forgotten so as to avoid repetition.  To understand where you are, you must know how you got here.

The town itself is even less charming. It's very centralized in the  sense that restaurants and shops are on a couple of streets.

The best tip is to get a transport pass which you can use for the trams, buses, ferry and trains/metro.  Taxis are cheap but Uber are even cheaper - from the airport to Costa de Caparica it was between 16 & 20 euros depending on traffic over the bridge.  
The beach is lovely, will lots of surf shops and restaurants.  The temperature was good, even though the Portuguese think it is cold, it was a pleasant 17 in the day, falling to 8-14 at night which would be great back home.
There are lots of pastelerias with amazing cakes, sandwiches and croissants, my favourite were the brioche croissants or freshly made sandwiches with sweet potato crisps.  Go explore Lisbon, it's amazing sites, lively market & food halls, the sardine shops and museums.  Would definitely return as there is plenty to do both sides of the river.  Wear comfy shoes as you will do a lot of walking and some of the streets are quite steep especially if you head up to the castle walls area.

I thought it wouldn't be anything different to the Madoura. How wrong was I as it was the best view ever that you can see of the whole of Lisbon.

You can literally see the airport runway, the April 25th bridge and a few other important landmark from the top of Amoreiras. 

There is a concrete slab that you can sit on or stand on to take pictures, there is also a single aluminium bench also for relaxation. The top of the Amoreiras is only a small area and we didn't have that many tourists at the time of visit, which made the viewing, relaxation and photographs a wonderful experience.

One is struck immediately about how modern this mall looks.  There are three floors filled with 160 stores.  Some are from the USA and some are not.  If you want to reach an Apple Store, it is called here the “iStore.”  The reviews for it, though, are subpar. 

At one end is a huge food court.  There are all types of kiosks selling not only Portuguese food, but Chinese, vegetarian and there is even a KFC. At lunch time it is extremely crowded. You will also notice that many of these vendors have silverware and ceramic bowls for their patrons.  You come here to really enjoy your meal.

We did find the bathrooms to be inviting, large and clean.  Seeing the Vasco da Gama Mall was fun and exciting.  One can spend an hour or a half a day at this mall.

This is a classic Siamese style pavilion, typical in appearance of what you can see throughout much of Thailand but on a small scale. Apparently, based on the information plague in front of the pavilion, this was a tributary gift to Portugal from the Thai government. The Thai Pavilion was inaugurated by Her Royal Highness, the Princess Maha Sirindhorn in 2012, and represents a token of friendship and recognition of 500 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. 

It is interesting to see oriental buildings like this in places like this in Portugal, which is just as likely to be just as much an object or curiosity for locals as it is for visitors.

The street, fully pedestrianized and adorned with that iconic Portuguese tile, is historic, safe, and reasonably clean. Some of the best shopping and dining can be found here.

It's about a 10 minute walk. A large part of it is lined with shops and restaurants but what I liked most was the traditional paving and the triumphal arch.
The pedestrian area is lined with Portuguese calçada, the traditional mosaic squares of limestone and black basalt. These tightly laid, black & white squared cobblestones are so striking. I just loved this about Lisbon. 
There are other more striking examples in Rossio Square and Largo de Camoes but because Rua Augusta is long and straight and stretches out in front of you, you get the full effect of the geometric, diamond patterning all the way down the middle and the borders of on the sides.
The other wow factor is the triumphal arch. As you get closer towards the river, the gleaming white triumphal arch looms in the distance. This is the magnificent gateway to the Praca do Commercio. It’s a very impressive sight.
There are lots of street performers which is fun if you have kids with you. The guys with the soccer balls are pretty amazing.
Shopping-wise, you’ll find lots of clothing, high-street brands like Zara, H&M, Pull and Bear and souvenirs. Whilst I could happily leave the shops alone on this trip, one did catch my eye.

The gardens are decorated with fountains, statues and other constructions from the seventeenth century, which are refreshing and make the walk through the premises a continuous delight. Although this is an inhabited Palace still today, visitors are welcome to take guided tours of the inside and enjoy visiting some of the most beautiful rooms, the Library, the terrace with ""azulejo"" panels representing the Liberal Arts, and the Chapel.
